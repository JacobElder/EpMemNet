<ul>
<li><p>Certain experiences we cannot know what experience will be like– and it’s consequences– until we undergo the experience; an epistemic challenge</p></li>

<li><p>Knowledge of what something is like and subjective point-of-view changes</p></li>
<li><p>Understand things in new way, gain new information</p></li>

<li><p>horrific physical attack, gaining a new sensory ability, having a traumatic accident, undergoing major surgery, winning an Olympic gold medal, participating in a revolution, having a religious conversion, having a child, experiencing the death of a parent, making a major scientific discovery, or experiencing the death of a child.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>Endel Tulving distinguished between <em>episodic</em> and <em>semantic</em> memory (Tulving, 1983)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Episodic Memory:</strong> mental representation of the self as the agent or patient of some action, or as the stimulus or experiencer of some state</p>
<ul>
<li><em>I gave a present to Lucy on her birthday</em> and <em>Lucy made me very happy yesterday</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Semantic Memory:</strong> is more generic, context-free knowledge about the world. Doesn’t necessarily have to be in self-reference.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Apples are red, green, or yellow fruits</em> or <em>I am a member of the middle class</em>, <em>I am more than 6 feet tall</em>, and <em>I am a neurotic extravert</em>.</li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="network-hypotheses">Network Hypotheses</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>H1: People will evaluate more positively, less negatively (i.e., more favorably) on memories with more downstram dependents.</p></li>
<li><p>H2: People will be more certain in memories with more downstream dependents.</p></li>
<li><p>H3: Memories with more dependents will be more clearly defined and accessible.</p></li>
<li><p>H4: Memories with more dependents will be farther back in time.</p></li>
</ol>
<hr>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li><p>H5: Memories with more dependents will be more fundamental to how people see themselves, and if they were changed, would change the person.</p></li>
<li><p>H6: Memories with more dependents will be more important to the person.</p></li>
<li><p>H7: Time will be associated with the number of implications, such that experiences farther back in time will have caused more other experiences.</p></li>
<li><p>H8: How broad/specific an experience is may be associated with some perceptions or moderate various associations– One example may be that broader memories will have more implications.</p></li>
</ol>
<hr>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li><p>H9: People’s self-report of retrospected emotions during an experience will be associated with how positively or negatively they perceive the experience.</p></li>
<li><p>H10: Memories with lower network constraint will be more differentiated. (pretty exploratory)</p></li>
<li><p>H11: People think more often about memories with more memories causing them</p></li>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> I remember singing ""This girl is on Fire"" by Alicia Keys in class and two of my fellow classmates complimenting me, then encouraging me to join my 5th grade's talent show. After their encouragement, I sang ""Just Give Me a Reason"" at the 5th grade talent show and my brother posted it on Youtube. This is a very fundamental memory for me because it shaped my continual development as a blossoming singer and made me realize/enjoy the feeling of bringing/entertaining people as a whole at events. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Auditioning for my high school's top madrigals choir and getting accepted was the start of my journey as a soprano section leader as well as the choir's top contra soprano to sing descants. It was a time of travel to the Mission Inn's church, Sizzler, Redland's University, and Cal State Fullerton where I sang carols/classical music and admired other choirs in competition. Also, it led me to sing the alma mater for my school's online graduation during Covid. These experiences shaped me as a musician and encouraged me to further hone these skills in college (and beyond if I audition for the Voice). However, it all started from a simple audition into it and acceptance, which I will never forget. </td>

  <tr>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> On the other hand, getting rejected from auditions (honor choir, solo songs in middle school, and my county's holiday music fair) taught me that it's ok to accept failure and mistakes, then to work on them rather than dwell on it. As a person, it taught me how to accept constructive criticism with grace and how to implement feedback. It also taught me the importance of adaptation to different contexts (sometimes you need to sing classical and other times, pop holiday music. The same could be said about life. Sometimes it's best to do things one way, but other times a new approach is needed). </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> My attendance to my Aunt's church in Riverside where the pastor engaged others' in biblical discussions and cited the importance of particular verses to our lives followed by pop church bands/musicians really changed my perspective on religion. In fact, I haven't been to church since Covid, but I have always told myself that I want to buy a bible from harvest church and go back to find a church that suits me. This is because I realized religion and spirituality doesn't have to be mundane and one dimensional in interpretation/view. It can be engaging an down to earth like real life. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> I remember in 8th grade I won an MVP award/medal for top grades and performance/personality as a student by my favorite history teacher named miss Brown. Personally, I never really like history (especially 1800s, civil wars, and geography). However, this memory makes me tear up sometimes because I was the last student she gave an award to before she got fired and rumors spread around about her absence (""she became ill and needed surgery,"" etc.). I never knew what happened to her and sometimes I miss the deep life talks I had with her (Ex: how to get involved in high school? Should I join certain clubs or classes if I feel I'm not well-suited for them? What's your best advice for high school and beyond?), but just the thought that a teacher had so much faith and hope in me as a student really influences me today when I experience imposter syndrome as an undergrad. I remember that I still have those basic qualities of a top student (perfect attendance, detailed notes, on time assignments mostly, and always asking questions) and I belong in academia. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Relatedly, I remember when my community college English 1B professor gave voice audio feedback on my semester paper to say that I should publish it in the school's journal/research portal because it was that well written. Also, I remember the fact that she literally edited my UCR essays in a couple days by 12 am and that her quote was ""Don't let perfection be the enemy of the good."" The very first part boosted my self-esteem as a writer and even influenced me to seek out research labs now. Also, it's reinforced my dream to possibly write a book and publish it or at least write my original songs for youtube. However, as someone with ADD and major procrastination issues due to heightened anxiety over having everything perfect, her quote has become my moto during tough times now as a student and again, her grading my essays really late made me realize that while we shouldn't override boundaries and be more responsible, you should have the minimum expectation that your faculty and colleagues want you to succeed because you're a good enough scholar/worker/person! </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> I remember my research methods professor in community college would give me internships and career advice during office hours but also during her class at the end of the semester. Also, I remember she said that even after her class, we can always reach out to her. In fact, she was one of the most generous and caring professors I had, but she also taught me that it's ok to ask for advice/help and it's ok to not have the whole future planned out. She taught me that I need to get involved in different opportunities to solidify my true passions. which I'm currently planning to do for next quarter by applying for work study and/or maybe a lab. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> While I hate my ex now, I remember being first asked out after our choir performances. It taught me how you can connect with someone with similar initial interests and what first love felt like. However, our couple of breakups, the reasons why, and my nights of crying to sleep (sometimes even during work shifts) really taught me what an unhealthy relationship looked like and what values I truly wanted (honesty not out of controlling but out of just respect and that deep friend connection, similar/the same conceptualizations of what cheating is, true inclusivity in shared friend groups (not just tolerance), prioritization in deep conversations (not solely just in giving gifts, physical affection, and dates. I wanted a balance in love languages), healthy work/life boundaries (aka respecting no call times during school/work), and the same future goals (Ex: marriage, no children but pets, etc.) as well as open-mindedness to differing political beliefs. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> A true memory I really love is when I first meet my now current boyfriend at my local grocery store when he asked if I needed help finding items in the baking aisle. He taught me how true connections can be made even in the most mundane contexts and that life is full of surprises, but also I found someone who has similar values and respects my boundaries. Plus, he's exposed me to different cultural customs since he's italian/german/hispanic and made me realize that the right person will go the extra step not just to surprise you with gifts, but to nurture you in your not so best times and accept you in them. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Recently, I hosted a wedding in Redland's citrus grove and a retirement event in the mountains at a farm for my brother's photobooth business. Those experiences grounded me with peace and allowed me to appreciate others' kindness (Ex: food giving, bug spray, etc.). Plus, it gave me perspective and possibilities for the future while also allowing me to gain wisdom from older individuals that have more life experience. Plus, it taught me the importance of taking a break in nature. </td>

My parents felt like the school system where we moved to was not very good compared to where we were before. My baby sister started to call the neighbor ""grandma"" and I think that is when my parents realized that we needed to come back home. Ever since then, we don't leave family. </td>

I remember I was able to grab a handful and the two people on both sides of me couldn't grab any fat. I became aware again that I had much more fat than others. That same day, my teacher also said that if we squeeze our thighs and are able to see dimples (cellulite) then we have too much fat and are overweight. Once again, the two people next to me had no dimples. Prior to this, I had no idea what cellulite was or that it was a 'bad' thing. I hesitated wearing shorts from that day on. I became extremely insecure about my legs as a child. </td>

The mom then started playing sexual music and was dancing on some of my guy friends. She was kissing their necks and giving lap dances. I felt very uncomfortable and not safe. That night, I came home and did not tell my parents a thing because I was scared of what they would do to the mom and I was scared of being embarrassed at school if my parents ""snitched"". On Monday, everyone on the bus was called into the principals office to give a report of what happened. I told the truth in my letter because I knew that it wasn't worth getting in more trouble for. People thought that I was the reason we all got called into the principal's office and they called me ""sam the snitch"" or ""snitch bitch"" or ""sam the snake"". They even posted pictures of me with the snake emoji covering my face. I was being blamed for 'snitching' when it wasn't me who told the office what happened in the bus. When my parents found out, they were in disbelief that I did not tell them. The police ended up getting involved, and somehow the mom was not punished. </td>

We went on a semi-date, decided to be friends, and became very close friends. In January 2022, we went snowboarding as a group of friends. Me and the boy I met on the second day of school ended up kissing that night, transforming our relationship from friendship to more.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Me and my (now ex) boyfriend started dating March 2022. We had been talking since January. I was hesitant because he is muslim and I am christian. I expressed my concerns and he said that we should not let that get in the way of our relationship because that is one small factor. I ended up agreeing, but it bothered me every day. He did not tell his parents that we were dating. Every time I would see them, I was nervous and felt pressured to be modest and not show that I liked him. This felt like lying. I told him I can't keep hiding this, and he ended up telling his parents. They were not mad and they welcomed me with open arms. I finally felt relief. We ended up falling deeper in love and celebrated many holidays together. I have never been treated so well in my entire life. I put in my everything into the relationship. Fast forward to January 2023, he broke up with me. He said that even though we are perfectly compatible, sometimes our differences in culture/religion are too much. He said I deserve better and that I deserve someone who shares the same beliefs as me. I am devastated. I was willing to compromise and was happy to compromise because it meant being with him, which was all I ever wanted. Even though I was willing to compromise, it wasn't enough. I am not enough.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> I remember being in middle school around my first year when i started to be friends with my partner in science class. my family is catholic but we were never supper religious like going to church every Sunday and every religious day/event. I remember how openly and confident she was in talking about going to church and being religious. Now that i realize it, she influenced me to become more accepting to myself. Shortly after my mom asked be if i wanted to sign up for communion classes because ultimately it was my choice and my mom said she wouldnt force me into a religion i dont want to practice. in the end that shaped how i went on with my classes because i decided that this would be the best option for me. Now my family and i try to go more often and not just on holidays since they started going to the parent portion of my classes which made all of us attend more and be a little more religious. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The way i see others has been shaped by how i have been treated and how i see others treated while at work. I have been working for over a year now and i remember when i first started of course i was slower still learning how to do things and customers would get mad and complain about the time even if it was just a minute. There was this customer who was really mad that they waited for new food and it wasnt served to them first despite him ordering after a few others waiting as well and has a few rude comments and i remember it bothering me and i looked around to my co workers who didnt seem fazed by it at all. They tried to continue to be patient and later returned the same attitude. I learned that this happens often and they just got use to it. I was told never to take it personally or to let it ruin my day because in a few short hours i would clock out and that person was long gone. this really shaped how i am now and my attitude because i realize that i cant show that i am scared or shy i need to be more strong and be able to control myself as well. this experience helped me implement what was always told to me. </td>

  <tr>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> when asked who i am i think of being a kind and protective person. I would say this because i have followed what my parents have shown me and how they have protected me. More specifically how they shielded me from things. when i was little i had a little blue fish like the ones in the single cups at petco. I sweared that it had been alive for a year and a half even though many told me they dont live that long. After a little while they told me he had died which made me really sad at the time but it wasnt until maybe 3 years ago that they told me they had bought over 10 replacements. I was shocked and a little upset that they just let me believe that it was just the one i was given the first time even after i reached an age where i would understand. a little bit of thinking made me realize that it was mainly to keep me happy as a child, not wanting to introduce me to death so young since i felt so close with my pet fish. Now i see how it was beneficial for a while and it shaped me to want to do the same in the sense that i want to protect others from harmful things. </td>

However, I often did not understand what some of these big words meant on these papers as a child, and my father would be extremely disappointed in me and tell me that my education was useless. I understood early on that I was not rewarded if I performed well, but was punished if I didn't, even if it escaped my capabilities at that time.

I looked on at this possible future version of myself and told myself that I should never become like her, and it has forced me to become someone more understanding of the people around me, unlike the young lady who could not understand her parent's circumstances. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> When I was living in South Korea, after having moved there during the ages 10-12, I noticed a lot of depression and sadness among students, including myself. I did not personally understand this phenomena, but I was terribly homesick in a country of people that looked like me, in a language that I had a hard time communicating with, and having been told I was a ticking failure of a person because I was not making great enough efforts to learn Korean and catch up to my peers. Only after having moved back, was I able to recover my demeanor, but the memory of burnt cigarettes and liquor bottles hidden in the benches in a middle school never left my mind, as well as having seen an elementary kid casually smoking a cigarette in the streets and acting like an adult. A horrible reminder of the harsh social pressures we as kids had to endure in Korea, and how easy it was to give up life when one was deemed a failure by everyone around them. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> I was once confessed to by a Filipino girl in my early highschool years, and I was willing to try this relationship out as she was very intelligent and beautiful, the things I guess normal teenagers care about at that age. However, when I relayed this to an older brother figure of mine, whom I deeply respected at the time, that I was dating this girl, he immediately told me that regardless of her personality, wits, or beauty if I dated this girl, because she was Filipino, he would never ever associate himself with me ever again. The very next day, I told her I could no longer date her, for reasons I did not tell her, I completely ghosted her without her understanding anything. I feel immense guilt over this from time to time, and I sometimes wonder if I should have ever told her. To tell her, was to help her understand that it wasn't that I didn't like her, but to also reveal the racist intentions that I succumbed to because of my relationship with a racist older brother figure. However, what complicates this is long after this had occurred, I learned that the year before I came to his highschool he hated a Chicano girl and he was socially outcasted from all of his Korean friends as a result. He was perhaps trying to prevent that from happening to me, while also doing the same thing his friends did to him. It made me really think about circumstance and personal experience as being influencers to behavior. </td>

A sliding tackle in order to stop the ball, which had left a friend of mine with facial scars. This prevented me from playing aggressively in sports ever again, as I was always afraid I would hurt somebody accidentally, and I would start playing safer, which left me losing all passion for certain sports. I apologized, but it wasn't enough, that injury would mark him forever and I had to responsible to never do it again. </td>

In this period of time, food was one of the only enjoyments I had in life, but not every food I adjusted to. Growing up on hamburgers and pizza, it was hard for me to casually consume school lunches in Korea that barely had any meat, and a lot of vegetables. However, I was really really happy when I could eat this street food and it has been one of my most important memories during this period of time. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> I was raise Christian but my world view aligned more with materialists. I changed my world view in the first week of college when I came to realized how Nihilistic and meaningless everything was with my current world view. Reflecting back on my life, I recognized how my past experiences have shaped who I am and lead me to this moment. I recognized how good my situation is compared to the less fortunate and how God has worked in my life. I decided to fully commit to Christianity henceforth. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> In elementary school I didn’t have many friends. I had one friend in first grade but in second grade we were separated into different classrooms. He made other friends and more often chose to play with them rather than maintain friendship with me. Every year in elementary school, I was split into a different classroom while my friends were placed in the same classroom. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> In 3rd grade, our teacher put a strong emphasis on writing. We wrote many essays and presented to the class. Writing was a weakness I struggle with and so I very much disliked all the writing assignments she assigned. However, at the end of the year, our teacher got in contact with the local ABC channel 7 news station and got us a field trip to go to the news studio where we presented our essays on the news station set. I remember feeling really nervous yet accomplished and privileged to have this experience. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> In college, I had a change to reflect on my past and what I had done. I recalled many of the things I did that I regret and was filled with conviction to confront my mistakes. When I returned home, I had a really awkward conversation with my family where I apologized for all the bad things I had done in the past and my poor behavior / character. Although I felt extremely embarrassed, I remember feeling relieved that I apologized while I had the chance. I feared that anyone of us could die any time and that I would regret not apologizing before it was too late. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> I remember in elementary school, I used to play recklessly and end up hurting people accidentally. One time I had pushed my friend and he stepped in mud with his new shoes. He was rightfully upset but I was bewildered why dirtying his shoes upset him so much. I remember just deciding that I won’t push my friend anymore. Throughout elementary school, there were several more incidents where I accidentally used too much strength. In every case I either got in trouble or felt remorse for the consequences. I’ve learned to just not be in physical contact with anyone ever. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> In 10th grade I had resolved myself to enroll in the International Baccalaureate (IB) program that was notoriously academically difficult. In addition, IB required students to have good public speaking, writing, and interpersonal skills, all of which were my weaknesses. I remember questioning my capabilities but in end, I decided to grit my teeth and struggle through it. In retrospect, although the experience was very difficult mentally, physically, emotionally, I am glad I did it. </td>

When I returned, I noticed my prizes were not in my pencil box. After reporting it to the teacher, she found that the girl who had stolen from me was my friend. Although she returned everything to me, I remember feeling betrayed but since the prizes were not really important to me, I was able to forgive shortly after. </td>

I had not expected this and thought it was really funny. Although I didn’t think much of this at the time, now that I’m older, I hold these memories endearing. </td>

My father talked about his experience as a veteran and taught me a lot on the responsibilities of gun ownership and the weight of wielding one. I also started thinking about how to protect myself and my family. </td>

And so he just shoved my fishing hook into a fish and told me I had caught a it. Looking back, I find this memory hilarious. </td>

I had a chair in this classroom that was mine for a good portion of the time. I remember sitting in this chair and sort of dozing off. On the surface it may not seem like a very influential memory but during this period of time I was really sick and I was struggling to even stay awake at school or at home. I have lots of memories of me just falling asleep in this chair during a time where I wasn't really paying attention to my surroundings and it feels like a really good summary of this time of my life. Falling asleep in the same chair everyday and not being able to control if I was awake or not. When I think ""Who am I?"" traumatic memories find their way to my thoughts first because they changed the way I thought about myself and life. Me being really sick like that is one of those memories because a small part of me still won't let go of the thought that my health may fail me when it is least expected, and I'll just be expected to live my life like nothing has happened again. </td>

I still remember it pretty much play by play even though its been 3 years now since it happened. I remember because after it happened I was asked to recount it to the people around me over and over until the events had carved themselves into my mind. I'd rather not recount the exact memories but the event itself changed the course of my life going forward. Many aspects of my life are different because of that Friday in November. For one I haven't spoken to my brother since then, and I feel more free. I am not happy that it happened but I am happy with the result. Even before my brother attacked me he wasn't someone I wanted to be around, and now I have a good excuse not too. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> A couple months after my brother attacked me I was living at a family friends house. It was January and my birthday. I had been having trouble concerning the people who still interacted with him which included my family and family friends. At the time it felt like it was either him or me and if you chose not to take a side, you chose his side. I remember being so angry and like no one was really listening to me or what I had to say. For my birthday my mom said that she would make me a cake and I wanted a pink cake. She kept asking if I wanted a pink ombre cake and I repeatedly told her no. This was a conversation that we had several times but low and behold she brought out a pink ombre cake on my birthday. I remember being so so angry and like that cake confirmed all of my worst fears. No one was listening to me and no one was going to listen to me. It was a miserable thought to have on my birthday. This event changed how I saw those people around me and how I see myself. I am an angrier person than I was before all that but I'm not as angry as I was while it was happening. I feel like I'm at a happy medium. I'm not longer keeping my anger under tight unescapable wraps, but I'm not inclined to anger to the smallest thing. I feel like I've now learned how to be angry in a healthy way, not too far in either direction. </td>

He proceeded to name many many traits of mine that are also traits of autism. This memory is a big turning point because I began to research and see if what he said had more truth to it than just a 4am thought. He was right and now I am very accepting of the fact that I have autism. This conversation let me be more myself by accepting more of myself. </td>

However, I remember feeling extremely sad about it at the time because I did not understand that people will drift over time, and find new people to spend their limited time with. I'd probably do the same to myself if I were in their shoes. I don't hold anything against them for it now, and I am glad they found new people, but I remember this because it was the first time I had to deal with watching what I thought I had slip away, as minor as it is in the grand scheme of things. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> This is a rather silly thing, but joining a certain Reddit website really contributed to my awareness of the toxicity and problems with gaming culture. After joining the Reddit group r/gamingcirclejerk, I realized that the hobby I had loved for all my life was harboring an extremely problematic culture, and was filled with horrible people. Namely, the group drew to my attention the rampant bigotry and toxic standards of conduct by a very large portion of the population. I value this because I would like to, in any way I can, change the community so that I could enjoy the hobby without fostering such hate, and has contributed to my pledge to be positive to people I meet in games. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> In freshman year of university, I was really struggling to meet new people after being separated from the friends I'd known for nine years at that point. To me, it seemed like I was the only one given that most of those friends were doing fine meeting new people to hang out with while I shackled myself to my past and didn't let myself let go. There was this one incident where some mutual friends came down from Northern California to meet up. I remember that they never once told me or invited me to anything, only showing up for dinner on the very last day of the week when one of them reached out and asked if I wanted to tag along. I did go since I had basically no other friends at that point, but sitting there and listening to all the things they were up to that week knowing full well that I was the only one there who was never invited really stuck with me. I ended up leaving early out of feeling overwhelmed, and the last thing one of them said to me before I left really stood out: he told me it was ""good seeing me."" This really stood out to me because I had felt at the time that if that were true, he would've reached out sooner to do things. I remember this night for two reasons. Firstly, it was the first emotional breakdown I've ever had (I think), and I ended up crying myself to sleep over it. Secondly, through the power of retrospect, it taught me to allow myself to let go of others and let them live their own lives, even if theirs intertwines with mine. Was it fair that they only remembered I existed at the very end and hung out with every single mutual friend we had but myself? Probably not. Is it my personal duty to ensure that I'm involved in activities that they may have not wanted to do with me? Absolutely not. It is not fair to them to expect inclusion of me, and it is not fair to myself to personally invest in other people's activities just because I have nothing to do. </td>

I didn't want to argue so I put on my earphones and blasted my music. He continued to talk and got upset when he realized I wasn't listening. He called my name and I turned to him with tears in my eyes. He didn't seem to care/notice me crying. He demanded that I hand him my earphones. When I did he started ripping them. I cried even more. Not necesarily because of the earphones, but what gives him the right to do that? It was a terrible way to express himself. </td>

He just drank and minded his business. But I remember the argukments I heard behind closed doors. That was what affected me immensely. I remember the sound of the door quietly opening, on those long nights. I knew my mom was waiting for him in the room. My siblings were asleep so they didn't hear. But I always heard and stayed up crying until I couldn't keep my eye lids open anymore. </td>

I invited friends, family, acquittances, and my parents invited more people. I was so excited to turn 21. My birthday is in November, so most of my friends were 21 already. I even got live music and my familly enjoyed that. Everyone was laughing, dancing, chatting, and over all having a good time. I didn't even care that it was cold outside. I had so much fun with my friends and family, and there was no arguing that day. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> My first tattoo. I got my first tat almost two years ago with my best friend. My brother drew for us the sketch that we had in mind. We went to the tattoo parlor and got the matching tattoo. I got it on my stomach and she got it on her ankle. I was super nervous I felt like I was going to pass out. It was embarrassing honestly cus the workers were so chill and laid back. I was also paranoid that my mom would find out but she was working. She actually called me about a different topic, and I was scared I would accidentally give myself away. It wasn’t as painful as I thought but it was a weird feeling. I felt like the needle was scratching me over and over again. But I loved the end result. And my parents still don’t know. </td>

Her reaction was exactly what I expected. She didn’t understand. But why? Girl you literally traumatized me. I didn’t say this of course, I just said I wanted to better myself. The situations that I had witnessed I wanted to stop being so upset over them. My mom eventually understood and she encouraged me to talk to my therapist about how to have better time management and other skills. </td>

I told him I can't keep hiding this, and he ended up telling his parents. They were not mad and they welcomed me with open arms. I finally felt relief. We ended up falling deeper in love and celebrated many holidays together. I have never been treated so well in my entire life. I put in my everything into the relationship. Fast forward to January 2023, he broke up with me. He said that even though we are perfectly compatible, sometimes our differences in culture/religion are too much. He said I deserve better and that I deserve someone who shares the same beliefs as me. I am devastated. I was willing to compromise and was happy to compromise because it meant being with him, which was all I ever wanted. Even though I was willing to compromise, it wasn't enough. I am not enough.

I never knew what happened to her and sometimes I miss the deep life talks I had with her (Ex: how to get involved in high school? Should I join certain clubs or classes if I feel I'm not well-suited for them? What's your best advice for high school and beyond?), but just the thought that a teacher had so much faith and hope in me as a student really influences me today when I experience imposter syndrome as an undergrad.

I was shocked and a little upset that they just let me believe that it was just the one i was given the first time even after i reached an age where i would understand. a little bit of thinking made me realize that it was mainly to keep me happy as a child, not wanting to introduce me to death so young since i felt so close with my pet fish.

However, when I relayed this to an older brother figure of mine, whom I deeply respected at the time, that I was dating this girl, he immediately told me that regardless of her personality, wits, or beauty if I dated this girl, because she was Filipino, he would never ever associate himself with me ever again. The very next day, I told her I could no longer date her, for reasons I did not tell her, I completely ghosted her without her understanding anything. I feel immense guilt over this from time to time, and I sometimes wonder if I should have ever told her. To tell her, was to help her understand that it wasn't that I didn't like her, but to also reveal the racist intentions that I succumbed to because of my relationship with a racist older brother figure. However, what complicates this is long after this had occurred, I learned that the year before I came to his highschool he hated a Chicano girl and he was socially outcasted from all of his Korean friends as a result. He was perhaps trying to prevent that from happening to me, while also doing the same thing his friends did to him.

There was this customer who was really mad that they waited for new food and it wasnt served to them first despite him ordering after a few others waiting as well and has a few rude comments and i remember it bothering me and i looked around to my co workers who didnt seem fazed by it at all. They tried to continue to be patient and later returned the same attitude. I learned that this happens often and they just got use to it. I was told never to take it personally or to let it ruin my day because in a few short hours i would clock out and that person was long gone. this really shaped how i am now and my attitude because i realize that i cant show that i am scared or shy i need to be more strong and be able to control myself as well. this experience helped me implement what was always told to me. </td>

I remember I was able to grab a handful and the two people on both sides of me couldn't grab any fat. I became aware again that I had much more fat than others. That same day, my teacher also said that if we squeeze our thighs and are able to see dimples (cellulite) then we have too much fat and are overweight. Once again, the two people next to me had no dimples. Prior to this, I had no idea what cellulite was or that it was a 'bad' thing. I hesitated wearing shorts from that day on.

Only after having moved back, was I able to recover my demeanor, but the memory of burnt cigarettes and liquor bottles hidden in the benches in a middle school never left my mind, as well as having seen an elementary kid casually smoking a cigarette in the streets and acting like an adult. A horrible reminder of the harsh social pressures we as kids had to endure in Korea, and how easy it was to give up life when one was deemed a failure by everyone around them. </td>

People thought that I was the reason we all got called into the principal's office and they called me ""sam the snitch"" or ""snitch bitch"" or ""sam the snake"". They even posted pictures of me with the snake emoji covering my face. I was being blamed for 'snitching' when it wasn't me who told the office what happened in the bus. When my parents found out, they were in disbelief that I did not tell them. The police ended up getting involved, and somehow the mom was not punished. </td>

However, when I relayed this to an older brother figure of mine, whom I deeply respected at the time, that I was dating this girl, he immediately told me that regardless of her personality, wits, or beauty if I dated this girl, because she was Filipino, he would never ever associate himself with me ever again. The very next day, I told her I could no longer date her, for reasons I did not tell her, I completely ghosted her without her understanding anything. I feel immense guilt over this from time to time, and I sometimes wonder if I should have ever told her. To tell her, was to help her understand that it wasn't that I didn't like her, but to also reveal the racist intentions that I succumbed to because of my relationship with a racist older brother figure. However, what complicates this is long after this had occurred, I learned that the year before I came to his highschool he hated a Chicano girl and he was socially outcasted from all of his Korean friends as a result. He was perhaps trying to prevent that from happening to me, while also doing the same thing his friends did to him.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Relatedly, I remember when my community college English 1B professor gave voice audio feedback on my semester paper to say that I should publish it in the school's journal/research portal because it was that well written. Also, I remember the fact that she literally edited my UCR essays in a couple days by 12 am and that her quote was ""Don't let perfection be the enemy of the good."" The very first part boosted my self-esteem as a writer and even influenced me to seek out research labs now. Also, it's reinforced my dream to possibly write a book and publish it or at least write my original songs for youtube. However, as someone with ADD and major procrastination issues due to heightened anxiety over having everything perfect, her quote has become my moto during tough times now as a student and again, her grading my essays really late made me realize that while we shouldn't override boundaries and be more responsible, you should have the minimum expectation that your faculty and colleagues want you to succeed because you're a good enough scholar/worker/person! </td>

It was a time of travel to the Mission Inn's church, Sizzler, Redland's University, and Cal State Fullerton where I sang carols/classical music and admired other choirs in competition. Also, it led me to sing the alma mater for my school's online graduation during Covid. These experiences shaped me as a musician and encouraged me to further hone these skills in college (and beyond if I audition for the Voice). However, it all started from a simple audition into it and acceptance, which I will never forget. </td>

This is because I realized religion and spirituality doesn't have to be mundane and one dimensional in interpretation/view. It can be engaging an down to earth like real life. </td>

She taught me that I need to get involved in different opportunities to solidify my true passions. which I'm currently planning to do for next quarter by applying for work study and/or maybe a lab. </td>

This specific experience made me realize how important money is and how little we had of it. This was also at a thrift store when people made fun of me for going thrifting since it was the only place my family could afford. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> When I was about 15 years old and my brother was around 17 or 18, I realized how much food he needed (he was on the football team, worked out a lot, etc). We still didn't have much money to spend on food that we really needed to be healthy so whenever we got fast food -- which he loves -- I would eat a very small portion and say I'm full so that he could get the extra food that I didn't touch. This made me conscious of how little we had, and how I should do my best to look after my family and others. </td>

<ul>
<li><p>Asymmetric stronger effects of implications relative to inward causes</p></li>
<li><p>Outward implications predicts how fundamental or important to change an experience was, how clearly defined/certain in memory one is, and how representative the experience is…</p></li>
<li><p>Inward causes predict positivity (across self-report and positivity of text used) but not negativity</p></li>
<li><p>Superordinance: More outward implications, more broad… Like foundation of a building, the most causal are the most broadward</p></li>

<li><p>There’s a lot of inward and outward effects, even if inward is weaker. Is it <em>really</em> directed?</p></li>
<li><p>Are these causal relations meaningful, or do people just “click” the memories that mean a lot to them more often?</p></li>
<li><p>Any others?</p></li>

<li><p>How can we modify/augment episodic memories?</p></li>
<li><p>How can we support that more implications == more transformative?</p></li>
<li><p>How can we support that if memory did not exist, it’s consequences would not either (i.e., counterfactual reasoning)?</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>“Assessments of causality. To test whether event A caused event B, we may undo A in our mind, and observe whether B still occurs in the simulation. Simulation can also be used to test whether A markedly increased the propensity of B, perhaps even made B inevitable. We suggest that a test of causality by simulation is involved in examples such as”you know very well that they would have quarrelled even if she had not mentioned his mother.” - Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1981</p></li>
