\subsection{Transformative
Experiences}\label{transformative-experiences}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Certain experiences we cannot know what experience will be like-- and
  it's consequences-- until we undergo the experience; an epistemic
  challenge
\item
  But also, many new/unknown experiences are personally transformative;
  will change your life and what it is like to be you
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{epistemic-transformation}{%
\subsection{Epistemic Transformation}\label{epistemic-transformation}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Experiencing color for the first time can't be fully anticipated until
  it has been experienced; can't learn it by being told, have to
  experience it
\item
  Knowledge of what something is like and subjective point-of-view
  changes
\item
  Understand things in new way, gain new information
\item
  Depends on how much one already knows, and the experience involved
\item
  Stories, testimony, and theories aren't enough to teach you what it is
  like
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{personal-transformation}{%
\subsection{Personal Transformation}\label{personal-transformation}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Some experiences can change your point of view, and by extension, your
  personal preferences, and perhaps even change the kind of person that
  you are or at least take yourself to be.
\item
  horrific physical attack, gaining a new sensory ability, having a
  traumatic accident, undergoing major surgery, winning an Olympic gold
  medal, participating in a revolution, having a religious conversion,
  having a child, experiencing the death of a parent, making a major
  scientific discovery, or experiencing the death of a child.

Transformation}\label{two-forms-of-transformation}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Can be epistemically transformative, giving you new information in
  virtue of your experience.
\item
  Can be personally transformative, changing how you experience being
  who you are.
\item
  Some experiences may be epistemically transformative while not being
  personally transformative, like tasting a durian for the first time.
  Some experiences may be personally transformative without being
  epistemically transformative.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{both-epistemic-and-personally-transformative}{%
\subsection{Both Epistemic and Personally
Transformative}\label{both-epistemic-and-personally-transformative}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Having a transformative experience (both personal and epistemic)
  teaches you something new, something that you could not have known
  before having the experience, while also changing you as a person.
\item
  Choices involving transformative experiences, that is, your
  transformative choices, allow you to causally form what it will be
  like to be you in your future.

\hypertarget{autobiographical-memory-episodic-and-semantic}{%
\subsection{Autobiographical Memory: Episodic and
Semantic}\label{autobiographical-memory-episodic-and-semantic}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Endel Tulving distinguished between \emph{episodic} and
  \emph{semantic} memory (Tulving, 1983)
\item
  \textbf{Episodic Memory:} mental representation of the self as the
  agent or patient of some action, or as the stimulus or experiencer of
  some state

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \emph{I gave a present to Lucy on her birthday} and \emph{Lucy made
    me very happy yesterday}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Semantic Memory:} is more generic, context-free knowledge
  about the world. Doesn't necessarily have to be in self-reference.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \emph{Apples are red, green, or yellow fruits} or \emph{I am a
    member of the middle class}, \emph{I am more than 6 feet tall}, and
    \emph{I am a neurotic extravert}.

\subsection{Episodic Memories as a Causal
Structure}\label{episodic-memories-as-a-causal-structure}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Associativist models assume undirected relation
\item
  Also, to my knowledge, associativist models of self as memory have
  been primarily theoretical/verbal
\item
  Present works attempts to formally model episodic memories as
  causal/directed
\item
  Further, attempts to provide link between causal structure and
  ``transformation''

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  H1: People will evaluate more positively, less negatively (i.e., more
  favorably) on memories with more downstram dependents.
\item
  H2: People will be more certain in memories with more downstream
  dependents.
\item
  H3: Memories with more dependents will be more clearly defined and
  accessible.
\item
  H4: Memories with more dependents will be farther back in time.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{4}
\item
  H5: Memories with more dependents will be more fundamental to how
  people see themselves, and if they were changed, would change the
  person.
\item
  H6: Memories with more dependents will be more important to the
  person.
\item
  H7: Time will be associated with the number of implications, such that
  experiences farther back in time will have caused more other
  experiences.
\item
  H8: How broad/specific an experience is may be associated with some
  perceptions or moderate various associations-- One example may be that
  broader memories will have more implications.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{8}
\item
  H9: People's self-report of retrospected emotions during an experience
  will be associated with how positively or negatively they perceive the
  experience.
\item
  H10: Memories with lower network constraint will be more
  differentiated. (pretty exploratory)
\item
  H11: People think more often about memories with more memories causing
  them

I remember singing ""This girl is on Fire"" by Alicia Keys in class and two of my fellow classmates complimenting me, then encouraging me to join my 5th grade's talent show. After their encouragement, I sang ""Just Give Me a Reason"" at the 5th grade talent show and my brother posted it on Youtube. This is a very fundamental memory for me because it shaped my continual development as a blossoming singer and made me realize/enjoy the feeling of bringing/entertaining people as a whole at events.\\
\hline
Uploading singing/piano covers and originals on youtube from 13-18 was an integral memory that made me realize my top value of emotional expression and open communication. Plus, it taught me perseverance and dedication/commitment as well as to pursue my dreams no matter what people said.\\
\hline
Auditioning for my high school's top madrigals choir and getting accepted was the start of my journey as a soprano section leader as well as the choir's top contra soprano to sing descants. It was a time of travel to the Mission Inn's church, Sizzler, Redland's University, and Cal State Fullerton where I sang carols/classical music and admired other choirs in competition. Also, it led me to sing the alma mater for my school's online graduation during Covid. These experiences shaped me as a musician and encouraged me to further hone these skills in college (and beyond if I audition for the Voice). However, it all started from a simple audition into it and acceptance, which I will never forget.\\
\hline
On the other hand, getting rejected from auditions (honor choir, solo songs in middle school, and my county's holiday music fair) taught me that it's ok to accept failure and mistakes, then to work on them rather than dwell on it. As a person, it taught me how to accept constructive criticism with grace and how to implement feedback. It also taught me the importance of adaptation to different contexts (sometimes you need to sing classical and other times, pop holiday music. The same could be said about life. Sometimes it's best to do things one way, but other times a new approach is needed).\\
\hline
My attendance to my Aunt's church in Riverside where the pastor engaged others' in biblical discussions and cited the importance of particular verses to our lives followed by pop church bands/musicians really changed my perspective on religion. In fact, I haven't been to church since Covid, but I have always told myself that I want to buy a bible from harvest church and go back to find a church that suits me. This is because I realized religion and spirituality doesn't have to be mundane and one dimensional in interpretation/view. It can be engaging an down to earth like real life.\\
\hline
I remember in 8th grade I won an MVP award/medal for top grades and performance/personality as a student by my favorite history teacher named miss Brown. Personally, I never really like history (especially 1800s, civil wars, and geography). However, this memory makes me tear up sometimes because I was the last student she gave an award to before she got fired and rumors spread around about her absence (""she became ill and needed surgery,"" etc.). I never knew what happened to her and sometimes I miss the deep life talks I had with her (Ex: how to get involved in high school? Should I join certain clubs or classes if I feel I'm not well-suited for them? What's your best advice for high school and beyond?), but just the thought that a teacher had so much faith and hope in me as a student really influences me today when I experience imposter syndrome as an undergrad. I remember that I still have those basic qualities of a top student (perfect attendance, detailed notes, on time assignments mostly, and always asking questions) and I belong in academia.\\
\hline
Relatedly, I remember when my community college English 1B professor gave voice audio feedback on my semester paper to say that I should publish it in the school's journal/research portal because it was that well written. Also, I remember the fact that she literally edited my UCR essays in a couple days by 12 am and that her quote was ""Don't let perfection be the enemy of the good."" The very first part boosted my self-esteem as a writer and even influenced me to seek out research labs now. Also, it's reinforced my dream to possibly write a book and publish it or at least write my original songs for youtube. However, as someone with ADD and major procrastination issues due to heightened anxiety over having everything perfect, her quote has become my moto during tough times now as a student and again, her grading my essays really late made me realize that while we shouldn't override boundaries and be more responsible, you should have the minimum expectation that your faculty and colleagues want you to succeed because you're a good enough scholar/worker/person!\\
\hline
I remember my research methods professor in community college would give me internships and career advice during office hours but also during her class at the end of the semester. Also, I remember she said that even after her class, we can always reach out to her. In fact, she was one of the most generous and caring professors I had, but she also taught me that it's ok to ask for advice/help and it's ok to not have the whole future planned out. She taught me that I need to get involved in different opportunities to solidify my true passions. which I'm currently planning to do for next quarter by applying for work study and/or maybe a lab.\\
\hline
Tutoring online for the DRC at my community college as well as the workshops required influenced me to become a more diversity accepting person and open minded person to learning from others. Plus, it taught me the power of being able to manage my own work schedule and how freedom in decisions is a huge value of mine in the workplace. Besides that, it's taught me that\\
\hline
While I hate my ex now, I remember being first asked out after our choir performances. It taught me how you can connect with someone with similar initial interests and what first love felt like. However, our couple of breakups, the reasons why, and my nights of crying to sleep (sometimes even during work shifts) really taught me what an unhealthy relationship looked like and what values I truly wanted (honesty not out of controlling but out of just respect and that deep friend connection, similar/the same conceptualizations of what cheating is, true inclusivity in shared friend groups (not just tolerance), prioritization in deep conversations (not solely just in giving gifts, physical affection, and dates. I wanted a balance in love languages), healthy work/life boundaries (aka respecting no call times during school/work), and the same future goals (Ex: marriage, no children but pets, etc.) as well as open-mindedness to differing political beliefs.\\
\hline
A true memory I really love is when I first meet my now current boyfriend at my local grocery store when he asked if I needed help finding items in the baking aisle. He taught me how true connections can be made even in the most mundane contexts and that life is full of surprises, but also I found someone who has similar values and respects my boundaries. Plus, he's exposed me to different cultural customs since he's italian/german/hispanic and made me realize that the right person will go the extra step not just to surprise you with gifts, but to nurture you in your not so best times and accept you in them.\\
\hline
Recently, I hosted a wedding in Redland's citrus grove and a retirement event in the mountains at a farm for my brother's photobooth business. Those experiences grounded me with peace and allowed me to appreciate others' kindness (Ex: food giving, bug spray, etc.). Plus, it gave me perspective and possibilities for the future while also allowing me to gain wisdom from older individuals that have more life experience. Plus, it taught me the importance of taking a break in nature.\\
\hline
While chaotic, I remember crying while taking an online midterm last year and how I still passed with an A/B. This taught me how strong/resilient I am as an academic scholar and how I'm able to persevere in the most difficult times through my inner motivating voice/thoughts. It taught me coping mechanisms for how to calm myself down really quick in contexts.\\
\hline
Being able to manage writing a research paper for my english class in community college while working 9 days a week (a little over part-time) taught me the power of time confetti and pomodoro, which I still use in my studying.\\

Even though it doesn't seem to be the righteous decision, I'm keen on redeeming myself.\\

In 6th grade elementary school, I was the best trombone player in school, got designated one of the top 2 band players, and got to play a solo during a band performance.\\
\hline
In 7th grade middle school, I was really bad at debate and had a partner who sucked even more, but during one debate I actually managed to convince some people in my class of my position. However, I goofed up and lost all support when I suggested something related to intentionally sacrificing US troops during war.\\
\hline
In spring of this year, I beat one of the hardest Mario levels called ""Champion's Road"" by myself without any in-game ""power-ups.""\\
\hline
One day around 2 years ago, me and my mom drove around and did several Pokemon Go boss battles and won around 6-7 times because of my strategies. It made me feel proud of my planning skills.\\
\hline
At the very start 9th grade, I finally decided to leave behind my toxic middle school friends who would constantly belittle my interests and peer pressure me into doing embarrassing things.\\
\hline
During my first week of 9th grade, I met new friends through a class acquiantaince who were more similar to me because they were focused on studies and accepting of my hobbies.\\
\hline
In 2019 February, I ran a 10k in Death Valley in just under an hour.\\
\hline
After years of slowly losing interest in it, I finally left behind the religion of Islam because I just didn't believe in any of it and had no passion for it.\\
\hline
One day when I was in Grand Teton National Park, I became obsessed with the Jalapeno Kettle Brand Chips that my brothers were eating. Ever since then, they have made me much more passionate about snacking.\\
\hline
In October of senior year of high school, I tried asking out this girl in my class, but she rejected me because she was a Muslim. It definitely hurt me inside, but I was able to peacefully take the loss.\\
\hline
When I ate food with meat from Taco Bell that wouldn't be permissible for a Muslim to eat, I felt like I was finally starting to become independent.\\
\hline
I worked at the medical records section of a clinic for a few months, and it helped me realize the value of working hard for your own money.\\
\hline
When I was in around 2nd grade, I finally was able to steadily ride on a bike after practicing a lot to balance myself. Soon, I became good enough to where I could kick off on my own without training wheels.\\
\hline
A few months ago, I was able to beat an entire Mario game without using any power-ups or game assistance tools.\\
\hline
Back in May, I was able to get a 4 and a 5 on my 2 AP exams. It made me appreciate the value of taking practice tests and studying.\\
\hline
Back in August, I started watching this Disney Cartoon called ""Amphibia"". I initially thought it was kind of boring, but soon came to appreciate its lessons about how you should always try to grow as a person.\\
\hline
Back in August of 2021, I passed my Driver's License Test on my first try. It made me proud of my ability to accomplish big feats on my own.\\
\hline
Just a few weeks ago, I got my mom to start watching the cartoon ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" with me. It helped me realize that even with how different we all are, it is possible to get my family members interested in my hobbies.\\
\hline
When my mom went to take care of her mom in India, I was able to become more independent by driving out on my own to buy groceries and meals for the rest of my family.\\

\hline
The Syrian Civil War was one of my earliest memories that shaped who I am. I remember the sound of gunshots and the echos of bombs to this day, and I remember how that experience made me grow up faster and realize the injustices of the world.\\
\hline
Moving to the United States and living with my Aunt for a couple of months and getting to know my cousin better and assimilating into American Culture. I remember getting off the plane and sitting next to my cousin who I am very close to now on the way to their house, being amazed by the roads and the houses we drove by.\\
\hline
My first day in an American school. I felt like an outcast since my English wasn't very good and found it frustrating to communicate with others, I also felt really behind compared to other students since I did not speak fluent English. I remember walking around by myself in the playground and trying to get used to everything.\\
\hline
Graduating from ELA. I was so happy to finish the English learners program in fourth grade and I remember my teacher jumping, screaming, and hugging me with joy because she was really happy for me and I felt proud of myself to have accomplished that.\\
\hline
My first day of middle school. I remember how I struggled to figure out how to open a locker and my older brother taught to me how to open one and how I was late to my first class with a teacher I did not like because I couldn't open my locker.\\
\hline
I remember attending summer camp for the first time in sixth grade. I really did not want to go, and I developed really bad social anxiety during that time. At first, I felt really uncomfortable and I just wanted to leave but then I grew to really like it and made really good friends there. I attended it every summer up until quarantine.\\
\hline
When my social anxiety got bad in middle school, I remember counting all the navy and white shirts in class everyday and if the shirt I was wearing is a color that was in the minority I would feel insecure for the rest of the day.\\
\hline
Not being friends with the friend I had since elementary school. I found out his friend was talking bad about me to others and was just over all really toxic towards me for the past few years, and I remember how freeing it was when I told her that I knew and walked away.\\
\hline
Grad night in middle school. I had a lot of fun and got to go on rides at six flags with my friends and laugh all night together.\\
\hline
first day of high school. I felt really nervous but I was really excited as well, and I got closer with someone who I knew from middle school but was not super close to and now were still best friends.\\
\hline
The arabic show. We do this show every year for my arabic class and the first year was so fun, I met two of my other best friends and we practiced doing traditional dances, songs, and plays. It was so fun and I felt super connected to my culture and felt like those around me were like my family in that class.\\
\hline
My grandpa's stroke. It was hard to see him go through that and to see my mom hurting from it.\\
\hline
The pandemic. When covid hit and we all had to quarantine it was really crazy and the last day before where everyone was nervous and unsure what's going on, we did not know that we weren't going to see each other for another year and a half. getting used to wearing masks, staying at home, social distancing and all was really hard.\\
\hline
My dad's cardiac arrest. Watching my dad go through dad in front of me and being in a coma for a while was really hard and one of the most life changing experiences. I was there when it happened and the image of him foaming at the mouth was hard to picture. I had to be there for my family, start working at our family ice cream shop, and pick up a lot of responsibilities as well as checking up on my dad (although I could not visit him because of covid)\\
\hline
Joining the IB program and specifically talking with my IB coordinator. When I talked to him, he was so understanding and supported and I felt that support was really important.\\
\hline
doing a summer program at ucla health. This program solidified my interest in pursing a career in medicine and I remember how fun learning different techniques like suturing was.\\
\hline
first day back to in person school. It felt really weird and so did the masks, trying to put online people to actual people was also weird.\\
\hline
College apps. Taught me perseverance and I remember working on them on halloween where I dressed up as pitbull, making me reflect on how much I grew from being social anxious to showing up to school in a bald cap.\\
\hline
IB Exams, hell on earth but also taught me perseverance and a lot of knowledge\\
\hline
College acceptances and rejections. Broke me down for an entire month in tears, but eventually I changed my perspective on things and I grew from that disappointment.\\
\hline
Graduation and the IB Banquet. It was hard to say bye to everyone but I was excited for a new chapter. I remember driving in the car screaming to music with my friends.\\

When I was in kindergarten, my family moved. I was very sad about leaving my friends and family. We thought the move was permanent, but ended up moving back 3 months later because we did not like the community and we did not like being away from everyone we loved. My parents felt like the school system where we moved to was not very good compared to where we were before. My baby sister started to call the neighbor ""grandma"" and I think that is when my parents realized that we needed to come back home. Ever since then, we don't leave family.\\
\hline
When I was in first grade, I got in trouble for the first time at school. A boy was bragging about how far back he could bend his finger and I was annoyed by this. I don't know why I did this (and to this day I regret it) but I said ""oh yea? well can you bend your finger back THIS far"" and I bent his finger back even further and ended up hurting him. After doing it I realized that I had hurt him and felt really guilty about it. I couldn't tell my mom about it because I was terrified of what she would do. Eventually she found out and was so disappointed in me.\\
\hline
In second grade I had a rock collection and people thought that was cool and different. I brought it to school.\\
\hline
In third grade, I started to realize that I was bigger in height and weight than my classmates. I was walking in the portable classroom and I remember a boy said ""earthquake"" when I was walking and they said I was like an ""elephant"". I had never realized my size until this day.\\
\hline
In 7th grade, I tried out for the dance team at my school. I was playing soccer at the time. I knew I wasn't amazing at dance, but I had done it for years when I was younger. I went to the door that they posted the results on and I checked the list 10 times, looking for my name. I did not find my name; I did not make the team. I felt extremely sad and disappointed and my parents tried to comfort me but I was not good enough.\\
\hline
In 6th grade, my teacher was teaching a health lesson. She told us that if we could grab a handful of fat from our stomach, then we are overweight and have too much fat. I remember I was able to grab a handful and the two people on both sides of me couldn't grab any fat. I became aware again that I had much more fat than others. That same day, my teacher also said that if we squeeze our thighs and are able to see dimples (cellulite) then we have too much fat and are overweight. Once again, the two people next to me had no dimples. Prior to this, I had no idea what cellulite was or that it was a 'bad' thing. I hesitated wearing shorts from that day on. I became extremely insecure about my legs as a child.\\
\hline
In 4th grade I started my period (I was 10). No one else had theirs and I was extremely embarrassed about it. I was terrified to tell my mom because I knew that I was too young to start my period and I did not know why I had started. When I told my mom, she freaked out and took me to the doctor because she was worried. It felt like I was not normal and like I did something wrong.\\
\hline
In 6th grade, I was sent to the principal's office because my shorts were 'too short'. I was wearing the exact same shorts that all of my friends were wearing, but I had a larger butt and thighs. She told me that I dress inappropriately and that I needed to buy longer shorts that fit me. I did not know what to do because I was the only one of my friends to get in trouble for wearing the exact same thing that they were wearing.\\
\hline
In eighth grade, I applied to be in ASB and did not make it in. All of my friends got in except for me. I was not good enough.\\
\hline
In high school, I was in ASB and people thought that I was a goody-two-shoes and would not want to invite me to things. I felt left out.\\
\hline
In my freshman year, I went on a party bus to midwinter. The mom on the bus brought out champagne for us (14 year olds) and everyone else except for me drank it. The mom then started playing sexual music and was dancing on some of my guy friends. She was kissing their necks and giving lap dances. I felt very uncomfortable and not safe. That night, I came home and did not tell my parents a thing because I was scared of what they would do to the mom and I was scared of being embarrassed at school if my parents ""snitched"". On Monday, everyone on the bus was called into the principals office to give a report of what happened. I told the truth in my letter because I knew that it wasn't worth getting in more trouble for. People thought that I was the reason we all got called into the principal's office and they called me ""sam the snitch"" or ""snitch bitch"" or ""sam the snake"". They even posted pictures of me with the snake emoji covering my face. I was being blamed for 'snitching' when it wasn't me who told the office what happened in the bus. When my parents found out, they were in disbelief that I did not tell them. The police ended up getting involved, and somehow the mom was not punished.\\
\hline
I went through a traumatic breakup my senior year. I was not good enough.\\
\hline
The pandemic happened. I lost 20 pounds very unhealthily. I obsessively worked out and refused to eat more than 1200 calories a day. I was cold all the time and irritable. I could not eat without feeling guilty. I did well in school.\\
\hline
Sophomore year of college was in person for the first time ever. I cried the first day because I had no friends. On the second day of school, a boy tapped me on the shoulder and asked to sit next to me. I said yes. After class, he asked for all of my social media information. We went on a semi-date, decided to be friends, and became very close friends. In January 2022, we went snowboarding as a group of friends. Me and the boy I met on the second day of school ended up kissing that night, transforming our relationship from friendship to more. I did not know how to tell my friends that we had progressed into more because I was scared of how it would affect our friendship. Eventually they found out and were hesitant yet supportive.\\
\hline
Me and my (now ex) boyfriend started dating March 2022. We had been talking since January. I was hesitant because he is muslim and I am christian. I expressed my concerns and he said that we should not let that get in the way of our relationship because that is one small factor. I ended up agreeing, but it bothered me every day. He did not tell his parents that we were dating. Every time I would see them, I was nervous and felt pressured to be modest and not show that I liked him. This felt like lying. I told him I can't keep hiding this, and he ended up telling his parents. They were not mad and they welcomed me with open arms. I finally felt relief. We ended up falling deeper in love and celebrated many holidays together. I have never been treated so well in my entire life. I put in my everything into the relationship. Fast forward to January 2023, he broke up with me. He said that even though we are perfectly compatible, sometimes our differences in culture/religion are too much. He said I deserve better and that I deserve someone who shares the same beliefs as me. I am devastated. I was willing to compromise and was happy to compromise because it meant being with him, which was all I ever wanted. Even though I was willing to compromise, it wasn't enough. I am not enough. Again.\\

Learning how to drive has shaped me because it had to be done in the moment i couldn't just wait for it to come to me because i needed to be able to drive myself to ucr and back home. it was hard because i did it all in a month, getting my permit, license and going farther than i had ever practiced. Its about an hour drive so i feel like i was able to grow and be stronger and believing in my capabilities much more.\\
\hline
I remember being in middle school around my first year when i started to be friends with my partner in science class. my family is catholic but we were never supper religious like going to church every Sunday and every religious day/event. I remember how openly and confident she was in talking about going to church and being religious. Now that i realize it, she influenced me to become more accepting to myself. Shortly after my mom asked be if i wanted to sign up for communion classes because ultimately it was my choice and my mom said she wouldnt force me into a religion i dont want to practice. in the end that shaped how i went on with my classes because i decided that this would be the best option for me. Now my family and i try to go more often and not just on holidays since they started going to the parent portion of my classes which made all of us attend more and be a little more religious.\\
\hline
The way i see others has been shaped by how i have been treated and how i see others treated while at work. I have been working for over a year now and i remember when i first started of course i was slower still learning how to do things and customers would get mad and complain about the time even if it was just a minute. There was this customer who was really mad that they waited for new food and it wasnt served to them first despite him ordering after a few others waiting as well and has a few rude comments and i remember it bothering me and i looked around to my co workers who didnt seem fazed by it at all. They tried to continue to be patient and later returned the same attitude. I learned that this happens often and they just got use to it. I was told never to take it personally or to let it ruin my day because in a few short hours i would clock out and that person was long gone. this really shaped how i am now and my attitude because i realize that i cant show that i am scared or shy i need to be more strong and be able to control myself as well. this experience helped me implement what was always told to me.\\
\hline
when asked who i am i think of being a kind and protective person. I would say this because i have followed what my parents have shown me and how they have protected me. More specifically how they shielded me from things. when i was little i had a little blue fish like the ones in the single cups at petco. I sweared that it had been alive for a year and a half even though many told me they dont live that long. After a little while they told me he had died which made me really sad at the time but it wasnt until maybe 3 years ago that they told me they had bought over 10 replacements. I was shocked and a little upset that they just let me believe that it was just the one i was given the first time even after i reached an age where i would understand. a little bit of thinking made me realize that it was mainly to keep me happy as a child, not wanting to introduce me to death so young since i felt so close with my pet fish. Now i see how it was beneficial for a while and it shaped me to want to do the same in the sense that i want to protect others from harmful things.\\
\hline
In general high school has taught me how unreliable people can be. I saw how much people talked behind each others backs and how to each others faces they said they were best friends and how well they got along. this really influenced me to keep to myself and not to tell too much to anyone. i could see the way different people acted with different sets of groups. just seeing this really influenced me to keep to myself more and being more shy.\\

However, I often did not understand what some of these big words meant on these papers as a child, and my father would be extremely disappointed in me and tell me that my education was useless. I understood early on that I was not rewarded if I performed well, but was punished if I didn't, even if it escaped my capabilities at that time. It was the beginning of my frustrations with doing things for other people which was largely not appreciated, which became expectancy, then disappointment when it wouldn't work out.\\
\hline
I had a really hard time making friends as a child, as having grown up in a strict household with a lot of rules, it did not make sense to me that children were blatantly disregarding them, and would often snitch on them as a kid. These often caused other kids to hate me, when I was just afraid of violating rules in which I learned to obey as a child.\\
\hline
During a period in which I started to begin hating to translate everything for my parents, at a financial office at the age of ten, I noticed there was a very old couple, with white and grey hair, in which were struggling immensely to get financial aid. Then minutes later, a young woman in a dress and a fancy handbag comes in, starts yelling at her old helpless parents, who looked so utterly fragile at this time, and being very frustrated on having to translate. I looked on at this possible future version of myself and told myself that I should never become like her, and it has forced me to become someone more understanding of the people around me, unlike the young lady who could not understand her parent's circumstances.\\
\hline
When I was living in South Korea, after having moved there during the ages 10-12, I noticed a lot of depression and sadness among students, including myself. I did not personally understand this phenomena, but I was terribly homesick in a country of people that looked like me, in a language that I had a hard time communicating with, and having been told I was a ticking failure of a person because I was not making great enough efforts to learn Korean and catch up to my peers. Only after having moved back, was I able to recover my demeanor, but the memory of burnt cigarettes and liquor bottles hidden in the benches in a middle school never left my mind, as well as having seen an elementary kid casually smoking a cigarette in the streets and acting like an adult. A horrible reminder of the harsh social pressures we as kids had to endure in Korea, and how easy it was to give up life when one was deemed a failure by everyone around them.\\
\hline
I was once confessed to by a Filipino girl in my early highschool years, and I was willing to try this relationship out as she was very intelligent and beautiful, the things I guess normal teenagers care about at that age. However, when I relayed this to an older brother figure of mine, whom I deeply respected at the time, that I was dating this girl, he immediately told me that regardless of her personality, wits, or beauty if I dated this girl, because she was Filipino, he would never ever associate himself with me ever again. The very next day, I told her I could no longer date her, for reasons I did not tell her, I completely ghosted her without her understanding anything. I feel immense guilt over this from time to time, and I sometimes wonder if I should have ever told her. To tell her, was to help her understand that it wasn't that I didn't like her, but to also reveal the racist intentions that I succumbed to because of my relationship with a racist older brother figure. However, what complicates this is long after this had occurred, I learned that the year before I came to his highschool he hated a Chicano girl and he was socially outcasted from all of his Korean friends as a result. He was perhaps trying to prevent that from happening to me, while also doing the same thing his friends did to him. It made me really think about circumstance and personal experience as being influencers to behavior.\\
\hline
I liked playing soccer, and I was really great at intersecting balls and defending, however I once made the brief mistake of replicating something I saw on television. A sliding tackle in order to stop the ball, which had left a friend of mine with facial scars. This prevented me from playing aggressively in sports ever again, as I was always afraid I would hurt somebody accidentally, and I would start playing safer, which left me losing all passion for certain sports. I apologized, but it wasn't enough, that injury would mark him forever and I had to responsible to never do it again.\\
\hline
In South Korea, my family was extremely poor, and I remember being so happy when I was afforced two dollars to buy a special treat called Tteokbokki. In this period of time, food was one of the only enjoyments I had in life, but not every food I adjusted to. Growing up on hamburgers and pizza, it was hard for me to casually consume school lunches in Korea that barely had any meat, and a lot of vegetables. However, I was really really happy when I could eat this street food and it has been one of my most important memories during this period of time.\\
\hline
I had a girl I liked as a young child, when I was in fifth grade, but she was a grade older. She was great at handball, which I really liked playing at that time, and she played rougher than anyone I knew, with such confidence. However, as she was older than me, she did graduate faster, and I never got the opportunity to interact with her ever again. I also soon moved, and I have never ever loved someone as romantically as I have had with her, ever again, although this occured when I was 10.\\
\hline
Recently, I started losing weight and slowly fixing my severe acne on my face. Perhaps due to this, when I was ordering a sandwich at Substation, the cashier had snuck in a guestcheck with her number in the back and a note that said ""call me"". Although I am not mentally ready to date as of this moment, this had greatly boosted my confidence in myself, but it also made me avoid this place as a result. I am largely grateful, but I think I need to be a better person before I start dating.\\

In high school, I was surprised to see a friend from middle school who had poor academic performance, excel in academics and got accepted into ivy league schools. I realized at that moment that my friend was smart but didn't care about school until high school. I realized that academics was not always a reliable indicator of intelligence or capability.\\
\hline
in 5th grade, I remember a classmate and I were doing particularly well in math. The teacher therefore gave us extra worksheets on extremely basic concepts in algebra. The other classmate would consistently finish the worksheets faster and with less mistakes compared to me. I remember feeling smart because I was doing work more advanced compared to my classmates yet not as smart as the other classmate who was doing it with me. He now goes to CalTech.\\
\hline
I took a summer class in algebra during middle school with 2 other students, one of which I maintained friendship with in high school. I remember struggling with the concept of factoring while my peers understood it fairly quickly. This was another time I felt I wasn't as smart as I thought I was.\\
\hline
In first grade, I remember I felt discouraged that I could not read chapter books while my peers were. I remember my mother getting me a book from the ""Frog and Toad"" series to practice. Upon completing a book, I felt a bit less discouraged but still felt I was behind my peers. I believe this moment was one of the reasons I enjoy reading today.\\
\hline
As a young child, I remember sitting on the stairs at my grandmother's house looking towards the front entrance. I had been there many times but for some reason the view felt almost foreign to me, as if I were seeing it for the first time. I still occasionally experience the same feeling but when I'm in different stores. Remembering the feeling changes my perspective on certain locations to make them feel as if they were new places.\\
\hline
In first grade, I remember looking at a picture of a 2D globe with people holding hands around it. It was weird to me that people in Antarctica were upside-down from my perspective but from their perspective, they would be right-side up. I remembering being confused and asking my parents why people in Antarctica weren't upside-down. They explained something about gravity that I just accepted at the time but didn't fully understand.\\
\hline
I remember in kindergarten, the teacher would lead an activity where she would teach us a letter of the alphabet and give examples. She taught the alphabet in order and used cards with the letter and an example image. I remember she would always ask us to guess what the example image on the card was. At this time, I would always ask to use the bathroom and use that opportunity to go to the neighboring empty classroom, which had all the cards displayed on the wall. I would return to class knowing the example for the letter of the day and pretended to “guess” the right answer.\\
\hline
I got my first video game when I was around 5-6 years old. I remember being so frustrated with the game because I could not read English well and didn’t know what to do. I later came back to the game and have since enjoyed playing video games.\\
\hline
I was over weight in elementary school and felt insecure about it. I tried to become the class clown to cope and make friends. But in middle school, there was another kid who was better at being the funny guy than I was. I remember giving up on being the funny guy and turned to academics. I didn’t care about school in elementary school but I felt a had a responsibility to prepare for the future now. Ever since then, academic success has been a major priority in my life.\\
\hline
In high school, my peers were consistently outperforming me in every subject and activity. This was when I was humbled and realized that I wasn’t as smart as I thought I was and being smart wasn’t an uncommon thing. However, I was convinced that as long as I worked hard enough, I could at least be on par with the best. In retrospect, I think it would have been better for my mental and physical health to become better than my past self than compete with my peers.\\
\hline
I was raise Christian but my world view aligned more with materialists. I changed my world view in the first week of college when I came to realized how Nihilistic and meaningless everything was with my current world view. Reflecting back on my life, I recognized how my past experiences have shaped who I am and lead me to this moment. I recognized how good my situation is compared to the less fortunate and how God has worked in my life. I decided to fully commit to Christianity henceforth.\\
\hline
In elementary school I didn’t have many friends. I had one friend in first grade but in second grade we were separated into different classrooms. He made other friends and more often chose to play with them rather than maintain friendship with me. Every year in elementary school, I was split into a different classroom while my friends were placed in the same classroom.\\
\hline
In 3rd grade, our teacher put a strong emphasis on writing. We wrote many essays and presented to the class. Writing was a weakness I struggle with and so I very much disliked all the writing assignments she assigned. However, at the end of the year, our teacher got in contact with the local ABC channel 7 news station and got us a field trip to go to the news studio where we presented our essays on the news station set. I remember feeling really nervous yet accomplished and privileged to have this experience.\\
\hline
In college, I had a change to reflect on my past and what I had done. I recalled many of the things I did that I regret and was filled with conviction to confront my mistakes. When I returned home, I had a really awkward conversation with my family where I apologized for all the bad things I had done in the past and my poor behavior / character. Although I felt extremely embarrassed, I remember feeling relieved that I apologized while I had the chance. I feared that anyone of us could die any time and that I would regret not apologizing before it was too late.\\
\hline
I remember in elementary school, I used to play recklessly and end up hurting people accidentally. One time I had pushed my friend and he stepped in mud with his new shoes. He was rightfully upset but I was bewildered why dirtying his shoes upset him so much. I remember just deciding that I won’t push my friend anymore. Throughout elementary school, there were several more incidents where I accidentally used too much strength. In every case I either got in trouble or felt remorse for the consequences. I’ve learned to just not be in physical contact with anyone ever.\\
\hline
In 10th grade I had resolved myself to enroll in the International Baccalaureate (IB) program that was notoriously academically difficult. In addition, IB required students to have good public speaking, writing, and interpersonal skills, all of which were my weaknesses. I remember questioning my capabilities but in end, I decided to grit my teeth and struggle through it. In retrospect, although the experience was very difficult mentally, physically, emotionally, I am glad I did it.\\
\hline
In kindergarten, I had won some small trinkets for something I can’t remember. I left it in my pencil box and went out to play during lunch. When I returned, I noticed my prizes were not in my pencil box. After reporting it to the teacher, she found that the girl who had stolen from me was my friend. Although she returned everything to me, I remember feeling betrayed but since the prizes were not really important to me, I was able to forgive shortly after.\\
\hline
I remember one day after picking me up from middle school, my grandmother asked me what I wanted to eat. I told her I wanted fried chicken but because her English was not very good, she only understood that I wanted chicken. She made me a boiled chicken dish. I had not expected this and thought it was really funny. Although I didn’t think much of this at the time, now that I’m older, I hold these memories endearing.\\
\hline
I remember as a young child playing Mario Party with my cousins. I remember just having so much fun and laughing with everyone over the smallest things.\\
\hline
In college, my dad took me to the shooting range where I learned to shoot a gun for the first time. I remember being nervous and fearful, particularly of hurting myself or anyone around me by accident. The more I shot and got used to it, the less fearful I was. I left the range still a bit fearful. My father talked about his experience as a veteran and taught me a lot on the responsibilities of gun ownership and the weight of wielding one. I also started thinking about how to protect myself and my family.\\
\hline
When I was a young child, my family and I went up to a small pond with some church friends to go fishing. This was my first experience fishing and so I was excited. I don’t remember much about the event except when one of adults fishing with us saw that I was struggling to catch any fish. And so he just shoved my fishing hook into a fish and told me I had caught a it. Looking back, I find this memory hilarious.\\
\hline
I remember in middle school some of my friends and I went to a friend’s house to hang out and play some games together. I remember having a good time, laughing and screaming with everyone.\\
\hline
In High school, my team and I took part in a robotics competition. I remember cheering for my team with all my teammates and celebrating qualifications to the national competition. When we returned to the hotel, I remember playing cards with my roommates and laughing until we couldn’t breathe. We fooled around before I reluctantly got to work on homework while my friends continued having fun.\\
\hline
My aunt used to have a pet tarantula. I remember in elementary school and middle school catching crickets with my cousin with our bare hands to give to my aunt, who would feed the spider. Although now I am not fond of bugs, I wasn’t so adverse to them when I was younger.\\
\hline
My high school gradation was a huge milestone for me. I had felt extremely accomplished and relieved to have finished high school, especially IB.\\
\hline
As an elementary schooler, I remember my mother getting me a science kit that used baking soda and vinegar to create a small volcano. We expected the volcano to be bigger but the whole activity was creating a small pile of baking soda and dripping vinegar with food dye on it to react. My mother’s exaggerated and sarcastic excitement made me laugh and became an inside joke.\\
\hline
When I first learned how to ride I bike, I rode straight into a bush full of spiders. While my parents laughed, I was mortified. They still tease me until this day.\\

I loved playing with our dog and watching the same movie over and over again. We would also eat hot pockets everyday.\\
\hline
I loved Saturday's with my dad as well. My mom would be at work until the night but me and my dad would spend all day together watching corny movies on SYFY and watching WWE as well.\\

I have had a wonderful friendship since I was in middle school, she helped shape who I am by sticking to her morals and beliefs and inspired me to do the same. Examples are when I broke down and the ways she was able to be there and comfort me. We went through tough times together (fights with friend groups, her leaving to a different school, etc.) but have always been by each other side.\\
\hline
One of my parents told me they wished that my brother had my intelligence and that I would have his intelligence (he is not as intelligent as I am in terms of academic standing). This caused me to distance myself from my family because of how hurtful their comments were.\\
\hline
Being disrupted during an online final during high school and failing that exam which prompted me to get a bad grade in a class I was otherwise doing well in. This caused me to want independence and control over my situation which I was able to achieve when I went to college.\\
\hline
Opening my college acceptances with someone who was close to me at the time and making random jokes because I was nervous. I didn't get accepted and said something (jokingly) that somehow came off hurtful so the person I was with guilt tripped me and started being all sad and emotional. Basically making the entire rest of the conversation about them when I was literally opening my college acceptance letter. This experienced caused me to be more independent and I developed a response of tending to others even when I am hurt.\\
\hline
Realizing that I was a pushover and being emotionally abused when my ex-boyfriend would always blame me for all his negative experiences in life and would calmly and periodically imply to self-harm if I ever left him (I was guilted into staying with him even though I disliked him). This made me notice all the negative people in my life and after cutting them off I was able to celebrate my achievements without blame. Also, I am now able to notice when I am being emotionally manipulated and allows me to be confrontational.\\
\hline
Being compared to my brother constantly (I received praise while he did not). I realized that this is what made him deeply dislike me even though we didn't have much interactions and if we did I normally would gift him something small. This caused me to try and mend our relationship and allowed for me to notice it in any future friendships that I had.\\
\hline
Having a relationship in which both sides were able to comfort each other. Specifically if I or he was to go through a rough time (e.g. switching jobs, moving schools, etc.) we would stay up late and comfort each other. This inspired and shaped me to be able to see when someone is struggling and want to help them in anyway I can because I know what it feels like to be in a place that is not so great.\\
\hline
Riding a scooter down hills when I was younger. I was able to hang out with my family and friends this way. It conditioned me to always love the outdoors since I was able to associate it with positive experiences.\\
\hline
Going to the same park trails since I was very very young. I was able to use this time to talk with whoever I was with about what was happening in my life and theirs.\\
\hline
Working out for the first time on a consistive schedule. It made me feel so powerful and good about myself! It helped me learn to love my body and associate working out and being health with positive feelings.\\
\hline
When I was younger about 7 to 9 years old, I tried to shoplift a toy (or something) by putting it in a backpack that my mom was going to buy for school. We didn't have any money that could be spent (only on the essentials). I obviously got caught at the register and my mom scolded me and I never did it again. This specific experience made me realize how important money is and how little we had of it. This was also at a thrift store when people made fun of me for going thrifting since it was the only place my family could afford.\\
\hline
When I was about 15 years old and my brother was around 17 or 18, I realized how much food he needed (he was on the football team, worked out a lot, etc). We still didn't have much money to spend on food that we really needed to be healthy so whenever we got fast food -- which he loves -- I would eat a very small portion and say I'm full so that he could get the extra food that I didn't touch. This made me conscious of how little we had, and how I should do my best to look after my family and others.\\
\hline
Coming home in 4th or 5th grade with the first 2 on my report card (there is a system of 1-4, where if you got a 1 is the equivalent of a D or F and 4 is an A). My parents were disappointed but not overly so. This is the point where my academic validation habit began.\\
\hline
Realizing systematic racism in middle school and throughout high school. I noticed the patterns of how a majority of the kids in the honors and AP classes would be rich and white while kids in the regular classes were hispanic or latino.\\
\hline
Overhearing how a classmate of mine has a private tutor in middle school which is the reason why he was in advanced classes. I realized to money difference between my classmates and I and how fortunate some people are and how they don't realize it. It made me understand and notice the things I am grateful for and ungrateful for.\\
\hline
The first time the word organic food was brought up in my environmental class (11th grade). I learned about all the negative-harmful chemicals that the FDA allowed for in our foods and realized that is why people are so unhealthy in the USA. I learned to be mindful of what I consume and saying no to harmful foods is okay (e.g. soda, fast food, etc.)\\

My first fight. I was around the age 9 or 10 when it happened. My sister is deaf and was around 11 or 12. She was walking her dog up and down the street while I was in the living room of our house. I heard a sceam and knew it was my sister. I ran outside in flip flops and white muscle shirt. I see three boys around the same age poking my sister and the dog with a stick. I see that and grab the cloest thing to me which was a broom handle and took action. I went over there and fought all three little boys.\\
\hline
The very first time I was offered weed. I was in sixth grade and I have a friend who had a good heart but came from a broken home. He was always there for me and he grew up to be part of the street life style. Anyway, we were starting 7th grade and the first day before going he had brought weed. I did not partake but he smoked it in front of me before school.\\
\hline
The day I was accpeted to my first college. It was late, around 11pm on a school night. My senior year and I am waiting to hear back from colleges. So that night I check my email and see my first acceptance. I was beyond estatic. I knew I was going somewhere, that all my hard work paid off.\\
\hline
There was one morning in my first year of college where I had an 8am class. I woke up at 7:45 and saw my alarm going off. I was so tired and decided to go back to sleep. I went back to sleep for about 2 mintues until I heard my dad's voice. His voice was saying, ""If I can get up to go work a 4am, you can get up to go to class at 8. I then got up and walked to class.\\

Going into college I get kicked out and move in with my ex-girlfriend, at first everything goes well, later ends badly as she gets used to me paying for everything, I am expected to pay for everything. She also tells me 3 months before we break up that she does not love me so I try my best by buying everything she wants. I should have left before when she was texting another guy and she laughed in front of her face and her mom even comforted me. There is more but I finally decided it was enough and left and packed my things in one day and I was tired of being just a wallet and wanted to be treated like a human again.\\
\hline
For a period of time after my break up I felt happier, again started to pay more attention to my looks, I had lost 20-30 pounds from the time, as after 2020 I weighed around 220, so at the time 190 in 2022. I started to go the gym more and also started to eat more healthy, and while I ate still a good amount it was healthier and cheaper than before as I used to only eat out(Such as fast food). I lose 15 more pounds so now at 175 around 2022 September.\\
\hline
During September I meet a my most recent ex girlfriend, everything was good in the beginning, but she was a bad influences and smoked weed, also was sleeping with many other guys. I found out the hard way and cut her off. She was cheating on her boyfriend and he was crazy and helped with a attempted murder. He threated me on the phone and knew where I worked and asked me to tell him the truth so I did. So I did and later my ex would egg my car and scratch my car where it just got painted(I will explain that bellow)\\
\hline
My car had just got repainted because I was rear ended at a stop light, I started recording and she even said I am not the expert driver> I would later open a claim on AAA as she had not, my car had to be towed home. Finally after getting into contact over almost a month, she denies liability. I pay \$1000 out of my own pocket for repairs.\\
\hline
In the past few months I exercise harder than ever. Life is not fair. We are not created equal. Hard work is the only way. I lose more weight pay more attention to my looks. My weight now being 144. I lost 70 pounds in 2022. I am alone, busy as I am a full time student and also work 5 days a week, but feel better than ever.\\

In senior year of high school one of the classes I had was a psychology class and the teacher had a bunch of couches and chairs in the room besides the desk. I had a chair in this classroom that was mine for a good portion of the time. I remember sitting in this chair and sort of dozing off. On the surface it may not seem like a very influential memory but during this period of time I was really sick and I was struggling to even stay awake at school or at home. I have lots of memories of me just falling asleep in this chair during a time where I wasn't really paying attention to my surroundings and it feels like a really good summary of this time of my life. Falling asleep in the same chair everyday and not being able to control if I was awake or not. When I think ""Who am I?"" traumatic memories find their way to my thoughts first because they changed the way I thought about myself and life. Me being really sick like that is one of those memories because a small part of me still won't let go of the thought that my health may fail me when it is least expected, and I'll just be expected to live my life like nothing has happened again.\\
\hline
In my sophomore year of high school my brother attacked me. He is 8 years older than me and it was the scariest thing I have ever experienced. I still remember it pretty much play by play even though its been 3 years now since it happened. I remember because after it happened I was asked to recount it to the people around me over and over until the events had carved themselves into my mind. I'd rather not recount the exact memories but the event itself changed the course of my life going forward. Many aspects of my life are different because of that Friday in November. For one I haven't spoken to my brother since then, and I feel more free. I am not happy that it happened but I am happy with the result. Even before my brother attacked me he wasn't someone I wanted to be around, and now I have a good excuse not too.\\
\hline
A couple months after my brother attacked me I was living at a family friends house. It was January and my birthday. I had been having trouble concerning the people who still interacted with him which included my family and family friends. At the time it felt like it was either him or me and if you chose not to take a side, you chose his side. I remember being so angry and like no one was really listening to me or what I had to say. For my birthday my mom said that she would make me a cake and I wanted a pink cake. She kept asking if I wanted a pink ombre cake and I repeatedly told her no. This was a conversation that we had several times but low and behold she brought out a pink ombre cake on my birthday. I remember being so so angry and like that cake confirmed all of my worst fears. No one was listening to me and no one was going to listen to me. It was a miserable thought to have on my birthday. This event changed how I saw those people around me and how I see myself. I am an angrier person than I was before all that but I'm not as angry as I was while it was happening. I feel like I'm at a happy medium. I'm not longer keeping my anger under tight unescapable wraps, but I'm not inclined to anger to the smallest thing. I feel like I've now learned how to be angry in a healthy way, not too far in either direction.\\
\hline
I started reading this story called Dark Matter and finished the whole thing in one night, staying up late. This story made me become interested in Batman comics which have become a big part of my personality because I love them so much. Most people who know me know that I love batman comics, it an easy open to get to know me better. With all of my interests I love them passionately.\\
\hline
I was having a sleepover with my best friend Kal, we had stayed up pretty late and it was approaching 5 am. We were talking about neurodivergence and Kal sort of looked at me and asked me something along the lines of if I knew that I had autism. This really surprised me and I was basically like ""What???"" He proceeded to name many many traits of mine that are also traits of autism. This memory is a big turning point because I began to research and see if what he said had more truth to it than just a 4am thought. He was right and now I am very accepting of the fact that I have autism. This conversation let me be more myself by accepting more of myself.\\

There was a time where, during middle and high school, my dad would often use my brother's accomplishments to set a standard for me to follow. There was a time where he bought my brother a laptop for school since he needed one, but used that as an opportunity to lambast my (relative) ""lack"" of achievement in front of the whole family. I remember this because this was one of the few times I have cried in front of other people for a reason that wasn't being a kid + physical pain.\\
\hline
I used to fall into the online radicalization pipeline, and before I realized it I turned into a hateful and terrible person. This probably would've gone on for much longer, but my brother saved me from it. Specifically, he put me on blast in front of some of his friends while we were on vacation, and the sudden realization that the brother I had always admired and looked up to was so disappointed in what I'd become was a real wakeup call for me. Since then, I have been much better about it (which, honestly, is the bare minimum to NOT be a bigoted, resentful person).\\
\hline
In high school, I can remember watching as all the friends I had slowly left me. I can't blame them, since I was a very awkward person who had little grasp on social situations at the time, so it would've been a detriment to their budding friendships with new people to keep me around. However, I remember feeling extremely sad about it at the time because I did not understand that people will drift over time, and find new people to spend their limited time with. I'd probably do the same to myself if I were in their shoes. I don't hold anything against them for it now, and I am glad they found new people, but I remember this because it was the first time I had to deal with watching what I thought I had slip away, as minor as it is in the grand scheme of things.\\
\hline
This is a rather silly thing, but joining a certain Reddit website really contributed to my awareness of the toxicity and problems with gaming culture. After joining the Reddit group r/gamingcirclejerk, I realized that the hobby I had loved for all my life was harboring an extremely problematic culture, and was filled with horrible people. Namely, the group drew to my attention the rampant bigotry and toxic standards of conduct by a very large portion of the population. I value this because I would like to, in any way I can, change the community so that I could enjoy the hobby without fostering such hate, and has contributed to my pledge to be positive to people I meet in games.\\
\hline
In freshman year of university, I was really struggling to meet new people after being separated from the friends I'd known for nine years at that point. To me, it seemed like I was the only one given that most of those friends were doing fine meeting new people to hang out with while I shackled myself to my past and didn't let myself let go. There was this one incident where some mutual friends came down from Northern California to meet up. I remember that they never once told me or invited me to anything, only showing up for dinner on the very last day of the week when one of them reached out and asked if I wanted to tag along. I did go since I had basically no other friends at that point, but sitting there and listening to all the things they were up to that week knowing full well that I was the only one there who was never invited really stuck with me. I ended up leaving early out of feeling overwhelmed, and the last thing one of them said to me before I left really stood out: he told me it was ""good seeing me."" This really stood out to me because I had felt at the time that if that were true, he would've reached out sooner to do things. I remember this night for two reasons. Firstly, it was the first emotional breakdown I've ever had (I think), and I ended up crying myself to sleep over it. Secondly, through the power of retrospect, it taught me to allow myself to let go of others and let them live their own lives, even if theirs intertwines with mine. Was it fair that they only remembered I existed at the very end and hung out with every single mutual friend we had but myself? Probably not. Is it my personal duty to ensure that I'm involved in activities that they may have not wanted to do with me? Absolutely not. It is not fair to them to expect inclusion of me, and it is not fair to myself to personally invest in other people's activities just because I have nothing to do.\\
\hline
After being introduced to it by a friend, I started journaling around halfway through freshman year in university. It's not exactly a huge thing, but it has helped me compartmentalize my thoughts as well as (mostly for last year) lay out my grievances whether with myself or others. Also, it gave me a nice excuse to buy a cool fountain pen (for cheap at least), so that was nice too.\\

On my fourth birthday, I dug a deep hole in my grandma's backyard. I remember my grandma speaking to my family members in Spanish saying ""somebody go change this child before her mother sees her"" because I had my pink birthday dress covered in dirt.\\
\hline
In 2007, my family and I moved into our first home. Me and my sister did cart wheels in our new room. My parents were happy and I distinctly remember being excited to bring in our toys. We had packed our toys into a huge purple cardboard box that did not fit through the hallway leading to my new room.\\
\hline
When I was five years old, I took a picture with my cousins from my mom's side of the family. It was nine of us, ranging from the ages 5-12 and we were all wearing Lakers gear. I wore a Lakers cheerleader outfit.\\
\hline
In the first grade, a little boy tripped me when I was going down a ramp and when I fell I scraped my face pretty bad. The school called my mother, my grandparent went to pick me up five minutes later (literally because they lived across the street from the elementary school I went to). From a far I saw my mother approaching me and she was walking towards me fast, I knew she was upset, I didn't want to look at her so I walked home with my head down. When we got home, she took pictures of my face because she wanted to sue my school but I felt really embarrassed because my younger sisters first birthday had just passed and everyone saw my face all beat up.\\
\hline
The day I flunked the first grade is engraved in my memory. My parents had a meeting with my first grade teacher because I was a stubborn learner. My teacher told my mother that I was very smart and that the only thing in my way was myself. My dad stared at my mother with a look of hesitation and my mother paused and then proceeded to say she agreed with my teacher and that it was a hard choice but the best thing for me in the long run. That day, I felt like I hated my parents, specifically my mother. I cried the whole day because I felt so betrayed and embarrassed.\\
\hline
In the summer of 2008, I went on a roadtrip to Laughlin Nevada. I went with my entire family, more specifically I was in the car with my uncle and his children. My uncle Robert hauled the jet skis, had the best pit stops, and my favorite playlist. We sang the entire four hours until we got stuck in the Jack in the box Drive thru. It was so much fun.\\
\hline
When I was in middle school, I had a gun pointed at my face for the first time. I was exiting my grandmother's apartment complex when I saw my older cousin who was 14 at the time laying on the floor. Before I could process why he was on the floor, a white male mid age cop stepped forward pointing a gun to my face telling me to step back. My cousin was yelling at me to go back to call my aunt while the cops didn't want me to make any sudden movements. I said ""I'm 7 years old and I do not have anything that can hurt you"" as I slowly put my hands up and slowly walked backwards away. from the situation.\\
\hline
In 2017, I passed out in high school when I was in my AP English class. We were reading as a class, I rose my hand and said ""I don't feel well"". I was told my head dropped to the table and that I was unconscious for 14 minutes. When I woke up, I was in the ER and my parents were worried.\\

In Mrs.Dies class we read a lot of books and we even did a play based on a book, we all dressed up and our parents came to watch\\
\hline
In Mrs.Walkers class I was good at math, she would call us her calculators when we got an answer correct and we got treats like animal crackers and cheez-its\\
\hline
For my 6th grade ceremony we prepared a song for our parents, we received a certificate and all the 6th grade students' parents came to see us\\
\hline
In 6th grade we had a science field trip up in Big Bear, we stayed there for 3 days with our friends and teachers, we were able to see snow and play with it when we were there.\\
\hline
In the field trip, I remember we learned how to shoot a bow and arrow. We had dinner there too and it was so good!\\
\hline
In middle school, I was part of a science club, my science teacher had a pet snake and many other pets, we would have after school activities that required science and experiments. One of my favorite memories was making ice cream from scratch.\\
\hline
In middle school we had a school dance, I remember going with a group of friends and I remember taking a picture with them that I still have with me.\\
\hline
In middle school I remember running a mile every thursday, I was always in the back and one day I decided to run as fast as I could, I went from getting a 12 minute mile to a 7 minute mile. I was really proud of myself\\
\hline
In my last year of middle school graduation/ceremony, I remember crying because my friend was not going to the same highschool as me.\\
\hline
My first day of highschool was scary, I remember getting lost and a senior helped me find my class.\\
\hline
I remember getting straight A's for the first time my freshman year of highschool, I thought it would be hard but I was always on track of my grades and I was able to get a 4.0 gpa.\\
\hline
I remember receiving a high honor roll award along with my friends, we even qualified to enroll in honor courses and a college-preparation program that would let us take college courses with a community college and receive credit for highschool as well.\\
\hline
My sophmore year, I decided to join a sport with my friends, I joined cross country and later joined track and field.\\
\hline
I had so much fun in cross country and track and I joined for 2 years, we went on races and I was able to receive medals as well.\\
\hline
I became involved in school, I was president of my own club, we fund raised for a trip to Little Tokyo and we were interactive in school.\\
\hline
In highschool, we had many exams and I have always been a procrastinator, I would study a little but I was never the type of person that would stay up past midnight to study or do homework. I did what I could and that was enough for me.\\
\hline
I always had a strong personality, if something bothered me I took it personal and I stayed to myself, I isolated and if no one reached out to see what was wrong or to recognize that they did something wrong, then I would not direct a word and would end the friendship with them.\\
\hline
Junior year, friendships were difficult for me, maybe it was my fault but I decided to shut myself out and be alone for the year.\\
\hline
Senior year, I tried to be more interactive with people but I was not emotionally well, school got hard to handle, my family problems were too much and it took a toll on my mental health. Junior year and being by myself shaped me into someone else and I carried those feelings throughout the years. I didn't have anyone to talk to but I still made an effort to keep myself distracted and do my best.\\
\hline
Senior year, life was hard, from isolating myself, not having a social life because I didn't want to, to that social life being taken away from everyone completely. COVID-19 and the pandemic really changed my perspective on friendships and family.\\
\hline
Thankfully, during my senior year family life got a bit better and during COVID I did my best to get closer to my family, to rebuild the connection and bonds that I didn't have with my siblings, with my grandparents, with my uncles and with my parents.\\
\hline
COVID-19, family problems, financial issues, death of a family member.\\
\hline
COVID-19 made the problems that were already there even bigger, if you had ignored the problem and pushed it aside, the pandemic made it clear that those problems were not going away unless you faced it.\\
\hline
There's a funny memory when mask mandates were enforced, we didn't know how to use them, my mom was using her mask backwards with the blue part inside and the white outside, and I remember laughing so much.\\
\hline
However, there is still fear. I remember when COVID-19 was first being discussed, the day school was ended early with no clear response, the stores were emptied out, toilet paper was gone, medicine was gone, food was nearly gone, the cleared shelves were a frightening sight.\\
\hline
Because of COVID I did not have a graduation ceremony, what I took forward to during my years in highschool, was taken away from me, I had a drive-thru graduation and I felt happy but I am still sad that I didn't get to walk the field and see my family from the stands cheer for me as I receive my certificate.\\

When I graduated high school. It doesn't seem like a big deal but it was the biggest deal to me. As a first generation graduate I was so happy and proud to accomplish something that my whole familly was proud of. I felt a sense of pride when I walked across the stage and they read my name. The screaming and applause rang loudly in my ears. I was grinning the whole day, despite the unbearable heat.\\
\hline
Traveling. The beaches in Mexico are so beautiful. Although it has been few times that I travelled I really enjoyed it. Being in the clear water, I felt so at peace. I looked at the blue clear sky and I actually told myself, everything will be okay. Even if I didn't really believe it, I felt so at peace. There's just something about the beach. Also there were little waves and not many people so it felt more peaceful. I was with my whole family and for once, no one was arguing. We were just enjoying the views and each others' company.\\
\hline
My aunt being drunk and trying to hit my mom. I got in between them. I remember being so mad I was shaking. My mother and I don't have the best relationship. But that day I realized that I would really do anything for her. She is my rock. I would do anything to defend her and there was no way someone would lay a hand on her. Not on my watch! Especially my aunt(dad's sister) Who did she think she was???? One of the many reasons I don't like alcohol.\\
\hline
Buying my own pair of airpods. Why is it a core memory? My dad ripped apart my pair of earphones, so I bought myself Airpods. We were all in the car driving home from la. I was having a conversation with my parents and it escalated quickly. My dad proceeded to chew my out and lecture me. I didn't want to argue so I put on my earphones and blasted my music. He continued to talk and got upset when he realized I wasn't listening. He called my name and I turned to him with tears in my eyes. He didn't seem to care/notice me crying. He demanded that I hand him my earphones. When I did he started ripping them. I cried even more. Not necesarily because of the earphones, but what gives him the right to do that? It was a terrible way to express himself.\\
\hline
When my mom told my brother and I she was having another kid. She even showed us an ultra sound to confirm. I was so shock but super excited. I couldn't wait to have a baby to play with. I secretly hoped it would be a girl (I was wrong) but I was excited either way. I loved my brother but I knew we both would enjoy having another sibling to play with.\\
\hline
My dad being drunk. A lot of the times I don't remember. I was never hurt, physically at least. My dad never had an anger towards me or my siblings. He just drank and minded his business. But I remember the argukments I heard behind closed doors. That was what affected me immensely. I remember the sound of the door quietly opening, on those long nights. I knew my mom was waiting for him in the room. My siblings were asleep so they didn't hear. But I always heard and stayed up crying until I couldn't keep my eye lids open anymore.\\
\hline
My 21st birthday. It was the first time I decided to go all out for my birthday. My parents helped me plan and throw a party. I invited friends, family, acquittances, and my parents invited more people. I was so excited to turn 21. My birthday is in November, so most of my friends were 21 already. I even got live music and my familly enjoyed that. Everyone was laughing, dancing, chatting, and over all having a good time. I didn't even care that it was cold outside. I had so much fun with my friends and family, and there was no arguing that day.\\
\hline
My first tattoo. I got my first tat almost two years ago with my best friend. My brother drew for us the sketch that we had in mind. We went to the tattoo parlor and got the matching tattoo. I got it on my stomach and she got it on her ankle. I was super nervous I felt like I was going to pass out. It was embarrassing honestly cus the workers were so chill and laid back. I was also paranoid that my mom would find out but she was working. She actually called me about a different topic, and I was scared I would accidentally give myself away. It wasn’t as painful as I thought but it was a weird feeling. I felt like the needle was scratching me over and over again. But I loved the end result. And my parents still don’t know.\\
\hline
Telling my mom I was going to therapy. Looking back at this I’m not sure why I was so scared to tell my mom. I was always scared to tell her something. Her reaction was exactly what I expected. She didn’t understand. But why? Girl you literally traumatized me. I didn’t say this of course, I just said I wanted to better myself. The situations that I had witnessed I wanted to stop being so upset over them. My mom eventually understood and she encouraged me to talk to my therapist about how to have better time management and other skills.\\

One Thanksgiving when I was 10 I saw my grandfather sitting at the table all by himself. I went up to him and started talking to him. From that day on my grandfather became my favorite person in the whole wide world.\\
\hline
My junior year of high school when the pandemic happened my prom was canceled and I thought that I was just gonna get an extra 2 weeks off of school. When I finally went back to school it wasn't until my last month of senior year.\\
\hline
When I graduated high school I didn't think I was going to get to walk in front of my family. Turns out I had a ceremony and my whole family was there to see me graduate high school and become a 4th generation UCR student.\\
\hline
Over the pandemic when I lost my first grandparent. My whole perspective changed on what life meant and how I was going to continue on in my life without my grandpa.\\
\hline

\hline
When I joined a sorority being of fall quarter. I didn't know if I was even going to find a sorority that would take me or see myself fitting in. I've never felt as comfortable in my life as I do right now with my sorority sisters.\\
\hline
My first break up in high school from my first love. It wasn't a regular break up, he cheated on me. Now when it comes to relationships I can get very insecure and I often fear that it will happen again to me.\\
\hline
Finding out my sister has a bipolar disorder. She was diagnosed when she was 3. I always thought she hated me because of how she bullied me 24/7. She often physically abused me like attacking me with scissors and throwing objects at me. I had to dodge these just so that I didn't get hurt.\\
\hline
Having the cops called to my house because my sister attacked my mom and cried ""abuse"". This later led to CPS being called to my house and my parents almost being taken away from me.\\
\hline
In one of my family therapy sessions my parents broke down and the therapist called the police because they assumed that my father was abusing my mother. This was where I first developed my hatred for my younger sister. I had to go and live with my grandparents for a week and I didn't know if I was ever going to see my parents again.\\
\hline
Meeting my best friend in Kindergarden. Later on down the line we had tons of fights and now we don't talk as much as we used to. We've gone our separate ways and at times I can feel really lonely.\\

My junior year of high school my AVID class took a trip up North to visit different colleges. This was the first time I actually started to think about what major I wanted to go into and which college would be the best fit for me.\\
\hline
My senior year of high school after returning back from the pandemic, I didn't have any friends. No one would talk to me, invite me places, or socalize with me. My only friend was my younger sister who ultimately made friends all on her own. This along with my first year of college being remote, my depression and anxiety only increased. For awhile I thought I was the problem and that there was something wrong with me.\\
\hline
When I was 12 I broke down to my family in the car. I was feeling very suicidal and while I never attemped anything, I often self-harmed. I finally told my parents and this led to me getting a psychiatrist and going on anti-depressants.\\
\hline
Almost getting into a car accident with my family. These young kids ran out in the middle of the road when it was pitch black and if it hadn't have been for my mom braking as fast as she could, we would've crashed and hurt those children.\\
\hline
Getting my first job as a swim coach for 7-8 year old kids. This job influenced me to pick a career path that dealt with both the things I love. The environment and children. My ultimate goal is to encourage children on what they can do to help preserve our Earth for as long as possible.\\
\hline
Finally getting my license at 17. Not only getting it but also finally getting my first car from my parents. It was a hand-me-down from my mom but it's still the same car that I drive today.\\
\hline
Spending my summer's at the beach with my family. Always during the 4th of July and getting to see my cousins and uncle who lived out there. One summer I finally learned how to surf and looked forward to going to the beach just to hit the waves.\\
\hline
My sophomore year of high school I took a trip to Joshua Tree with my Environmental Science class. I always had an interest when it came to the environment but this opened my eyes up even more. However, it wasn't until my trip to Death Valley that I really started to appreciate all the things that life has to offer.\\
\hline
Over the summer, I learned that my orchestra teacher was diagnosed with brain cancer and was given 6 months to live. This man was someone who I confided in about my personal life all 4 years I was in high school. That same summer, 2 weeks after I found out about his diagnosis, he passed away. I had never been so distraught in my life. I lost a mentor and someone who I had always admired. I vowed that I would continue spreading his kindness to other people.\\
\hline
Celebrating my 18th birthday with just my family instead of all my friends like I normally did. I later learned on that you don't need a bunch of people to make you feel special, as long as you have those that really care about you that's all that matters.\\

While I hate my ex now, I remember being first asked out after our choir performances. It taught me how you can connect with someone with similar initial interests and what first love felt like. However, our couple of breakups, the reasons why, and my nights of crying to sleep (sometimes even during work shifts) really taught me what an unhealthy relationship looked like and what values I truly wanted (honesty not out of controlling but out of just respect and that deep friend connection, similar/the same conceptualizations of what cheating is, true inclusivity in shared friend groups (not just tolerance), prioritization in deep conversations (not solely just in giving gifts, physical affection, and dates. I wanted a balance in love languages), healthy work/life boundaries (aka respecting no call times during school/work), and the same future goals (Ex: marriage, no children but pets, etc.) as well as open-mindedness to differing political beliefs.\\

I liked playing soccer, and I was really great at intersecting balls and defending, however I once made the brief mistake of replicating something I saw on television. A sliding tackle in order to stop the ball, which had left a friend of mine with facial scars. This prevented me from playing aggressively in sports ever again, as I was always afraid I would hurt somebody accidentally, and I would start playing safer, which left me losing all passion for certain sports. I apologized, but it wasn't enough, that injury would mark him forever and I had to responsible to never do it again.\\

On the other hand, getting rejected from auditions (honor choir, solo songs in middle school, and my county's holiday music fair) taught me that it's ok to accept failure and mistakes, then to work on them rather than dwell on it. As a person, it taught me how to accept constructive criticism with grace and how to implement feedback. It also taught me the importance of adaptation to different contexts (sometimes you need to sing classical and other times, pop holiday music. The same could be said about life. Sometimes it's best to do things one way, but other times a new approach is needed).\\

Me and my (now ex) boyfriend started dating March 2022. We had been talking since January. I was hesitant because he is muslim and I am christian. I expressed my concerns and he said that we should not let that get in the way of our relationship because that is one small factor. I ended up agreeing, but it bothered me every day. He did not tell his parents that we were dating. Every time I would see them, I was nervous and felt pressured to be modest and not show that I liked him. This felt like lying. I told him I can't keep hiding this, and he ended up telling his parents. They were not mad and they welcomed me with open arms. I finally felt relief. We ended up falling deeper in love and celebrated many holidays together. I have never been treated so well in my entire life. I put in my everything into the relationship. Fast forward to January 2023, he broke up with me. He said that even though we are perfectly compatible, sometimes our differences in culture/religion are too much. He said I deserve better and that I deserve someone who shares the same beliefs as me. I am devastated. I was willing to compromise and was happy to compromise because it meant being with him, which was all I ever wanted. Even though I was willing to compromise, it wasn't enough. I am not enough. Again.\\

A true memory I really love is when I first meet my now current boyfriend at my local grocery store when he asked if I needed help finding items in the baking aisle. He taught me how true connections can be made even in the most mundane contexts and that life is full of surprises, but also I found someone who has similar values and respects my boundaries. Plus, he's exposed me to different cultural customs since he's italian/german/hispanic and made me realize that the right person will go the extra step not just to surprise you with gifts, but to nurture you in your not so best times and accept you in them.\\

Sophomore year of college was in person for the first time ever. I cried the first day because I had no friends. On the second day of school, a boy tapped me on the shoulder and asked to sit next to me. I said yes. After class, he asked for all of my social media information. We went on a semi-date, decided to be friends, and became very close friends. In January 2022, we went snowboarding as a group of friends. Me and the boy I met on the second day of school ended up kissing that night, transforming our relationship from friendship to more. I did not know how to tell my friends that we had progressed into more because I was scared of how it would affect our friendship. Eventually they found out and were hesitant yet supportive.\\

I remember in 8th grade I won an MVP award/medal for top grades and performance/personality as a student by my favorite history teacher named miss Brown. Personally, I never really like history (especially 1800s, civil wars, and geography). However, this memory makes me tear up sometimes because I was the last student she gave an award to before she got fired and rumors spread around about her absence (""she became ill and needed surgery,"" etc.). I never knew what happened to her and sometimes I miss the deep life talks I had with her (Ex: how to get involved in high school? Should I join certain clubs or classes if I feel I'm not well-suited for them? What's your best advice for high school and beyond?), but just the thought that a teacher had so much faith and hope in me as a student really influences me today when I experience imposter syndrome as an undergrad. I remember that I still have those basic qualities of a top student (perfect attendance, detailed notes, on time assignments mostly, and always asking questions) and I belong in academia.\\

Auditioning for my high school's top madrigals choir and getting accepted was the start of my journey as a soprano section leader as well as the choir's top contra soprano to sing descants. It was a time of travel to the Mission Inn's church, Sizzler, Redland's University, and Cal State Fullerton where I sang carols/classical music and admired other choirs in competition. Also, it led me to sing the alma mater for my school's online graduation during Covid. These experiences shaped me as a musician and encouraged me to further hone these skills in college (and beyond if I audition for the Voice). However, it all started from a simple audition into it and acceptance, which I will never forget.\\

Relatedly, I remember when my community college English 1B professor gave voice audio feedback on my semester paper to say that I should publish it in the school's journal/research portal because it was that well written. Also, I remember the fact that she literally edited my UCR essays in a couple days by 12 am and that her quote was ""Don't let perfection be the enemy of the good."" The very first part boosted my self-esteem as a writer and even influenced me to seek out research labs now. Also, it's reinforced my dream to possibly write a book and publish it or at least write my original songs for youtube. However, as someone with ADD and major procrastination issues due to heightened anxiety over having everything perfect, her quote has become my moto during tough times now as a student and again, her grading my essays really late made me realize that while we shouldn't override boundaries and be more responsible, you should have the minimum expectation that your faculty and colleagues want you to succeed because you're a good enough scholar/worker/person!\\

Being compared to my brother constantly (I received praise while he did not).

My attendance to my Aunt's church in Riverside where the pastor engaged others' in biblical discussions and cited the importance of particular verses to our lives followed by pop church bands/musicians really changed my perspective on religion. In fact, I haven't been to church since Covid, but I have always told myself that I want to buy a bible from harvest church and go back to find a church that suits me. This is because I realized religion and spirituality doesn't have to be mundane and one dimensional in interpretation/view. It can be engaging an down to earth like real life.\\

in 5th grade, I remember a classmate and I were doing particularly well in math. The teacher therefore gave us extra worksheets on extremely basic concepts in algebra.

I remember in elementary school, I used to play recklessly and end up hurting people accidentally. One time I had pushed my friend and he stepped in mud with his new shoes. He was rightfully upset but I was bewildered why dirtying his shoes upset him so much. I remember just deciding that I won’t push my friend anymore. Throughout elementary school, there were several more incidents where I accidentally used too much strength. In every case I either got in trouble or felt remorse for the consequences. I’ve learned to just not be in physical contact with anyone ever.\\

In second grade I had a rock collection and people thought that was cool and different. I brought it to school.\\

In general high school has taught me how unreliable people can be.

When I was in kindergarten, my family moved. I was very sad about leaving my friends and family. We thought the move was permanent, but ended up moving back 3 months later because we did not like the community and we did not like being away from everyone we loved. My parents felt like the school system where we moved to was not very good compared to where we were before. My baby sister started to call the neighbor ""grandma"" and I think that is when my parents realized that we needed to come back home. Ever since then, we don't leave family.\\

In 3rd grade, our teacher put a strong emphasis on writing. We wrote many essays and presented to the class.

However, at the end of the year, our teacher got in contact with the local ABC channel 7 news station and got us a field trip to go to the news studio where we presented our essays on the news station set. I remember feeling really nervous yet accomplished and privileged to have this experience.\\

I did not know what to do because I was the only one of my friends to get in trouble for wearing the exact same thing that they were wearing.\\
\hline
when asked who i am i think of being a kind and protective person. I would say this because i have followed what my parents have shown me and how they have protected me. More specifically how they shielded me from things. when i was little i had a little blue fish like the ones in the single cups at petco. I sweared that it had been alive for a year and a half even though many told me they dont live that long. After a little while they told me he had died which made me really sad at the time but it wasnt until maybe 3 years ago that they told me they had bought over 10 replacements. I was shocked and a little upset that they just let me believe that it was just the one i was given the first time even after i reached an age where i would understand. a little bit of thinking made me realize that it was mainly to keep me happy as a child, not wanting to introduce me to death so young since i felt so close with my pet fish. Now i see how it was beneficial for a while and it shaped me to want to do the same in the sense that i want to protect others from harmful things.\\

When I was a young child, my family and I went up to a small pond with some church friends to go fishing. This was my first experience fishing and so I was excited. I don’t remember much about the event except when one of adults fishing with us saw that I was struggling to catch any fish. And so he just shoved my fishing hook into a fish and told me I had caught a it. Looking back, I find this memory hilarious.\\
\hline
When I was about 15 years old and my brother was around 17 or 18, I realized how much food he needed (he was on the football team, worked out a lot, etc). We still didn't have much money to spend on food that we really needed to be healthy so whenever we got fast food -- which he loves -- I would eat a very small portion and say I'm full so that he could get the extra food that I didn't touch. This made me conscious of how little we had, and how I should do my best to look after my family and others.\\

In college, I had a change to reflect on my past and what I had done. I recalled many of the things I did that I regret and was filled with conviction to confront my mistakes. When I returned home, I had a really awkward conversation with my family where I apologized for all the bad things I had done in the past and my poor behavior / character. Although I felt extremely embarrassed, I remember feeling relieved that I apologized while I had the chance. I feared that anyone of us could die any time and that I would regret not apologizing before it was too late.\\

When my parents called me failure for college rejections even though I highly believed that my grades weren't the attribute of my rejection even from my safety schools.

In 7th grade middle school, I was really bad at debate and had a partner who sucked even more, but during one debate I actually managed to convince some people in my class of my position.

Opening my college acceptances with someone who was close to me at the time and making random jokes because I was nervous. I didn't get accepted and said something (jokingly) that somehow came off hurtful so the person I was with guilt tripped me and started being all sad and emotional. Basically making the entire rest of the conversation about them when I was literally opening my college acceptance letter. This experienced caused me to be more independent and I developed a response of tending to others even when I am hurt.\\

I remember being in middle school around my first year when i started to be friends with my partner in science class. my family is catholic but we were never supper religious like going to church every Sunday and every religious day/event. I remember how openly and confident she was in talking about going to church and being religious. Now that i realize it, she influenced me to become more accepting to myself. Shortly after my mom asked be if i wanted to sign up for communion classes because ultimately it was my choice and my mom said she wouldnt force me into a religion i dont want to practice. in the end that shaped how i went on with my classes because i decided that this would be the best option for me. Now my family and i try to go more often and not just on holidays since they started going to the parent portion of my classes which made all of us attend more and be a little more religious.\\
\hline
In 10th grade I had resolved myself to enroll in the International Baccalaureate (IB) program that was notoriously academically difficult. In addition, IB required students to have good public speaking, writing, and interpersonal skills, all of which were my weaknesses. I remember questioning my capabilities but in end, I decided to grit my teeth and struggle through it. In retrospect, although the experience was very difficult mentally, physically, emotionally, I am glad I did it.\\

In my freshman year, I went on a party bus to midwinter. The mom on the bus brought out champagne for us (14 year olds) and everyone else except for me drank it. The mom then started playing sexual music and was dancing on some of my guy friends. She was kissing their necks and giving lap dances. I felt very uncomfortable and not safe. That night, I came home and did not tell my parents a thing because I was scared of what they would do to the mom and I was scared of being embarrassed at school if my parents ""snitched"". On Monday, everyone on the bus was called into the principals office to give a report of what happened. I told the truth in my letter because I knew that it wasn't worth getting in more trouble for. People thought that I was the reason we all got called into the principal's office and they called me ""sam the snitch"" or ""snitch bitch"" or ""sam the snake"". They even posted pictures of me with the snake emoji covering my face. I was being blamed for 'snitching' when it wasn't me who told the office what happened in the bus. When my parents found out, they were in disbelief that I did not tell them. The police ended up getting involved, and somehow the mom was not punished.\\
\hline
I was once confessed to by a Filipino girl in my early highschool years, and I was willing to try this relationship out as she was very intelligent and beautiful, the things I guess normal teenagers care about at that age. However, when I relayed this to an older brother figure of mine, whom I deeply respected at the time, that I was dating this girl, he immediately told me that regardless of her personality, wits, or beauty if I dated this girl, because she was Filipino, he would never ever associate himself with me ever again. The very next day, I told her I could no longer date her, for reasons I did not tell her, I completely ghosted her without her understanding anything. I feel immense guilt over this from time to time, and I sometimes wonder if I should have ever told her. To tell her, was to help her understand that it wasn't that I didn't like her, but to also reveal the racist intentions that I succumbed to because of my relationship with a racist older brother figure. However, what complicates this is long after this had occurred, I learned that the year before I came to his highschool he hated a Chicano girl and he was socially outcasted from all of his Korean friends as a result. He was perhaps trying to prevent that from happening to me, while also doing the same thing his friends did to him. It made me really think about circumstance and personal experience as being influencers to behavior.\\
\hline
While chaotic, I remember crying while taking an online midterm last year and how I still passed with an A/B. This taught me how strong/resilient I am as an academic scholar and how I'm able to persevere in the most difficult times through my inner motivating voice/thoughts. It taught me coping mechanisms for how to calm myself down really quick in contexts.\\

when i was around 9, my older sister was 18 and would get paid to babysit myself and my younger siblings, 7 and 3. She would sleep while i would attempt to make food and take care of the youngest.\\
\hline
As a young child, I remember sitting on the stairs at my grandmother's house looking towards the front entrance. I had been there many times but for some reason the view felt almost foreign to me, as if I were seeing it for the first time. I still occasionally experience the same feeling but when I'm in different stores. Remembering the feeling changes my perspective on certain locations to make them feel as if they were new places.\\

My first episodic memory I can remember was when I got in trouble in kindergarten for getting in a fight with another kid. My mom did not hit me but was emotionally disappointed in me which forever changed me as a person in a way where I became more considerate of others.\\
\hline
When I was living in South Korea, after having moved there during the ages 10-12, I noticed a lot of depression and sadness among students, including myself. I did not personally understand this phenomena, but I was terribly homesick in a country of people that looked like me, in a language that I had a hard time communicating with, and having been told I was a ticking failure of a person because I was not making great enough efforts to learn Korean and catch up to my peers. Only after having moved back, was I able to recover my demeanor, but the memory of burnt cigarettes and liquor bottles hidden in the benches in a middle school never left my mind, as well as having seen an elementary kid casually smoking a cigarette in the streets and acting like an adult. A horrible reminder of the harsh social pressures we as kids had to endure in Korea, and how easy it was to give up life when one was deemed a failure by everyone around them.\\
\hline
Realizing that I was a pushover and being emotionally abused when my ex-boyfriend would always blame me for all his negative experiences in life and would calmly and periodically imply to self-harm if I ever left him (I was guilted into staying with him even though I disliked him). This made me notice all the negative people in my life and after cutting them off I was able to celebrate my achievements without blame. Also, I am now able to notice when I am being emotionally manipulated and allows me to be confrontational.\\

My sessions with my therapist and my hard-headed side that is incapable of change in beliefs, helped understand that therapy is dependent on the patient. People only change when they want to and/or is open to change. Therapy isn't a magic remedy, it is more of emotional regulation.\\
\hline
In first grade, I remember I felt discouraged that I could not read chapter books while my peers were. I remember my mother getting me a book from the ""Frog and Toad"" series to practice. Upon completing a book, I felt a bit less discouraged but still felt I was behind my peers. I believe this moment was one of the reasons I enjoy reading today.\\
\hline
Just a few weeks ago, I got my mom to start watching the cartoon ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" with me. It helped me realize that even with how different we all are, it is possible to get my family members interested in my hobbies.\\

Learning how to drive has shaped me because it had to be done in the moment i couldn't just wait for it to come to me because i needed to be able to drive myself to ucr and back home. it was hard because i did it all in a month, getting my permit, license and going farther than i had ever practiced. Its about an hour drive so i feel like i was able to grow and be stronger and believing in my capabilities much more.\\

Being disrupted during an online final during high school and failing that exam which prompted me to get a bad grade in a class I was otherwise doing well in. This caused me to want independence and control over my situation which I was able to achieve when I went to college.\\

My sixth memory was when I visited my aunt in the hospital who have some sort of heart problem around 2010 I believe. I felt very scared thinking of what would become of her is she wasn't cured. (luckily she was and is doing good today)\\

While me and my brother were playing one day, I fell and busted my eye open. This caused my blood vessles to pop and I ended up going to the hospital the next day.\\
\hline
I remember one day after picking me up from middle school, my grandmother asked me what I wanted to eat. I told her I wanted fried chicken but because her English was not very good, she only understood that I wanted chicken. She made me a boiled chicken dish. I had not expected this and thought it was really funny. Although I didn’t think much of this at the time, now that I’m older, I hold these memories endearing.\\

My dad not being a ""hard"" man, so I grew up as a soft person, which led to me wondering if I am manly enough\\

I took a summer class in algebra during middle school with 2 other students, one of which I maintained friendship with in high school. I remember struggling with the concept of factoring while my peers understood it fairly quickly. This was another time I felt I wasn't as smart as I thought I was.\\
\hline
The very first time I was offered weed. I was in sixth grade and I have a friend who had a good heart but came from a broken home. He was always there for me and he grew up to be part of the street life style. Anyway, we were starting 7th grade and the first day before going he had brought weed. I did not partake but he smoked it in front of me before school.\\

The day I was accpeted to my first college. It was late, around 11pm on a school night. My senior year and I am waiting to hear back from colleges. So that night I check my email and see my first acceptance. I was beyond estatic. I knew I was going somewhere, that all my hard work paid off.\\

One day in sixth grade, I became so overwhelmed that I started crying during P.E. and continued crying for another 45 minutes until I went back home.\\
\hline
I remember when these boys at school in my chemistry class would ask me questions about different sports and their teams. They wanted to see if I was really intrested in sports or if I was lying. I always knew what I was talking about and for some reason it surprised them. This made me want to learn even more about the world of sports.\\
\hline
In third grade, I started to realize that I was bigger in height and weight than my classmates. I was walking in the portable classroom and I remember a boy said ""earthquake"" when I was walking and they said I was like an ""elephant"". I had never realized my size until this day.\\
\hline
When I was younger about 7 to 9 years old, I tried to shoplift a toy (or something) by putting it in a backpack that my mom was going to buy for school. We didn't have any money that could be spent (only on the essentials). I obviously got caught at the register and my mom scolded me and I never did it again. This specific experience made me realize how important money is and how little we had of it. This was also at a thrift store when people made fun of me for going thrifting since it was the only place my family could afford.\\
\hline
In 7th grade, I tried out for the dance team at my school. I was playing soccer at the time. I knew I wasn't amazing at dance, but I had done it for years when I was younger. I went to the door that they posted the results on and I checked the list 10 times, looking for my name. I did not find my name; I did not make the team. I felt extremely sad and disappointed and my parents tried to comfort me but I was not good enough.\\
\hline
I was with my mom, aunt, and older sister when we got into a freeway accident on the way home. My life literally flashed between my eyes.\\
\hline
My first day in an American school. I felt like an outcast since my English wasn't very good and found it frustrating to communicate with others, I also felt really behind compared to other students since I did not speak fluent English. I remember walking around by myself in the playground and trying to get used to everything.\\
\hline
When I was a kid, there was an instance I was poking my head out the window and accidentally pressed the button that made the glass window reach all the way to my neck. Although my dad was telling me to stop moving while he was trying to get in the car, I figured out in my head that if the space I accidentally pressed made the window go up, the other side would let it go down and I did so even though my father was yelling not to. At the age of seven, I had a lot of confidence in myself I guess.\\
\hline
I had a really hard time making friends as a child, as having grown up in a strict household with a lot of rules, it did not make sense to me that children were blatantly disregarding them, and would often snitch on them as a kid. These often caused other kids to hate me, when I was just afraid of violating rules in which I learned to obey as a child.\\
\hline
During my sophomore year in high school, my mom made a bet with me to get Straight A's and then I could have a TV in my room. I ended up getting the A's and she bought me a TV a couple weeks later that my dad set up.\\

Me and my brother used to play minecraft every saturday together in our loft. We would always build houses together but then when I would move out, he would set my house on fire and kill me.\\
\hline
In first grade, I remember looking at a picture of a 2D globe with people holding hands around it. It was weird to me that people in Antarctica were upside-down from my perspective but from their perspective, they would be right-side up. I remembering being confused and asking my parents why people in Antarctica weren't upside-down. They explained something about gravity that I just accepted at the time but didn't fully understand.\\
\hline
The way i see others has been shaped by how i have been treated and how i see others treated while at work. I have been working for over a year now and i remember when i first started of course i was slower still learning how to do things and customers would get mad and complain about the time even if it was just a minute. There was this customer who was really mad that they waited for new food and it wasnt served to them first despite him ordering after a few others waiting as well and has a few rude comments and i remember it bothering me and i looked around to my co workers who didnt seem fazed by it at all. They tried to continue to be patient and later returned the same attitude. I learned that this happens often and they just got use to it. I was told never to take it personally or to let it ruin my day because in a few short hours i would clock out and that person was long gone. this really shaped how i am now and my attitude because i realize that i cant show that i am scared or shy i need to be more strong and be able to control myself as well. this experience helped me implement what was always told to me.\\
\hline
In 4th grade I started my period (I was 10). No one else had theirs and I was extremely embarrassed about it. I was terrified to tell my mom because I knew that I was too young to start my period and I did not know why I had started. When I told my mom, she freaked out and took me to the doctor because she was worried. It felt like I was not normal and like I did something wrong.\\
\hline
The first time the word organic food was brought up in my environmental class (11th grade). I learned about all the negative-harmful chemicals that the FDA allowed for in our foods and realized that is why people are so unhealthy in the USA. I learned to be mindful of what I consume and saying no to harmful foods is okay (e.g. soda, fast food, etc.)\\
\hline
I remember in kindergarten, the teacher would lead an activity where she would teach us a letter of the alphabet and give examples. She taught the alphabet in order and used cards with the letter and an example image. I remember she would always ask us to guess what the example image on the card was. At this time, I would always ask to use the bathroom and use that opportunity to go to the neighboring empty classroom, which had all the cards displayed on the wall. I would return to class knowing the example for the letter of the day and pretended to “guess” the right answer.\\
\hline
In college, my dad took me to the shooting range where I learned to shoot a gun for the first time. I remember being nervous and fearful, particularly of hurting myself or anyone around me by accident. The more I shot and got used to it, the less fearful I was. I left the range still a bit fearful. My father talked about his experience as a veteran and taught me a lot on the responsibilities of gun ownership and the weight of wielding one. I also started thinking about how to protect myself and my family.\\
\hline
My dad's cardiac arrest. Watching my dad go through dad in front of me and being in a coma for a while was really hard and one of the most life changing experiences. I was there when it happened and the image of him foaming at the mouth was hard to picture. I had to be there for my family, start working at our family ice cream shop, and pick up a lot of responsibilities as well as checking up on my dad (although I could not visit him because of covid)\\
\hline
When I was in first grade, I got in trouble for the first time at school. A boy was bragging about how far back he could bend his finger and I was annoyed by this. I don't know why I did this (and to this day I regret it) but I said ""oh yea? well can you bend your finger back THIS far"" and I bent his finger back even further and ended up hurting him. After doing it I realized that I had hurt him and felt really guilty about it. I couldn't tell my mom about it because I was terrified of what she would do. Eventually she found out and was so disappointed in me.\\
\hline
My parents do not speak English, and since I was in elementary school, I have had to translate everything in between complicated documents regarding citizenship to simple utility bills. However, I often did not understand what some of these big words meant on these papers as a child, and my father would be extremely disappointed in me and tell me that my education was useless. I understood early on that I was not rewarded if I performed well, but was punished if I didn't, even if it escaped my capabilities at that time. It was the beginning of my frustrations with doing things for other people which was largely not appreciated, which became expectancy, then disappointment when it wouldn't work out.\\
\hline
During a period in which I started to begin hating to translate everything for my parents, at a financial office at the age of ten, I noticed there was a very old couple, with white and grey hair, in which were struggling immensely to get financial aid. Then minutes later, a young woman in a dress and a fancy handbag comes in, starts yelling at her old helpless parents, who looked so utterly fragile at this time, and being very frustrated on having to translate. I looked on at this possible future version of myself and told myself that I should never become like her, and it has forced me to become someone more understanding of the people around me, unlike the young lady who could not understand her parent's circumstances.\\

In 6th grade, my teacher was teaching a health lesson. She told us that if we could grab a handful of fat from our stomach, then we are overweight and have too much fat. I remember I was able to grab a handful and the two people on both sides of me couldn't grab any fat. I became aware again that I had much more fat than others. That same day, my teacher also said that if we squeeze our thighs and are able to see dimples (cellulite) then we have too much fat and are overweight. Once again, the two people next to me had no dimples. Prior to this, I had no idea what cellulite was or that it was a 'bad' thing. I hesitated wearing shorts from that day on. I became extremely insecure about my legs as a child.\\

I don't know why I did this (and to this day I regret it) but I said ""oh yea? well can you bend your finger back THIS far"" and I bent his finger back even further and ended up hurting him. After doing it I realized that I had hurt him and felt really guilty about it. I couldn't tell my mom about it because I was terrified of what she would do.

Also, I am now able to notice when I am being emotionally manipulated and allows me to be confrontational.\\
\hline
In 4th grade I started my period (I was 10). No one else had theirs and I was extremely embarrassed about it. I was terrified to tell my mom because I knew that I was too young to start my period and I did not know why I had started.

\hline
When I was living in South Korea, after having moved there during the ages 10-12, I noticed a lot of depression and sadness among students, including myself. I did not personally understand this phenomena, but I was terribly homesick in a country of people that looked like me, in a language that I had a hard time communicating with, and having been told I was a ticking failure of a person because I was not making great enough efforts to learn Korean and catch up to my peers. Only after having moved back, was I able to recover my demeanor, but the memory of burnt cigarettes and liquor bottles hidden in the benches in a middle school never left my mind, as well as having seen an elementary kid casually smoking a cigarette in the streets and acting like an adult. A horrible reminder of the harsh social pressures we as kids had to endure in Korea, and how easy it was to give up life when one was deemed a failure by everyone around them.\\

My parents do not speak English, and since I was in elementary school, I have had to translate everything in between complicated documents regarding citizenship to simple utility bills. However, I often did not understand what some of these big words meant on these papers as a child, and my father would be extremely disappointed in me and tell me that my education was useless. I understood early on that I was not rewarded if I performed well, but was punished if I didn't, even if it escaped my capabilities at that time. It was the beginning of my frustrations with doing things for other people which was largely not appreciated, which became expectancy, then disappointment when it wouldn't work out.\\

I remember in elementary school, I used to play recklessly and end up hurting people accidentally. One time I had pushed my friend and he stepped in mud with his new shoes. He was rightfully upset but I was bewildered why dirtying his shoes upset him so much. I remember just deciding that I won’t push my friend anymore. Throughout elementary school, there were several more incidents where I accidentally used too much strength. In every case I either got in trouble or felt remorse for the consequences. I’ve learned to just not be in physical contact with anyone ever.\\

Opening my college acceptances with someone who was close to me at the time and making random jokes because I was nervous. I didn't get accepted and said something (jokingly) that somehow came off hurtful so the person I was with guilt tripped me and started being all sad and emotional. Basically making the entire rest of the conversation about them when I was literally opening my college acceptance letter. This experienced caused me to be more independent and I developed a response of tending to others even when I am hurt.\\

In 7th grade, I tried out for the dance team at my school. I was playing soccer at the time. I knew I wasn't amazing at dance, but I had done it for years when I was younger. I went to the door that they posted the results on and I checked the list 10 times, looking for my name. I did not find my name; I did not make the team.

I had a really hard time making friends as a child, as having grown up in a strict household with a lot of rules, it did not make sense to me that children were blatantly disregarding them, and would often snitch on them as a kid. These often caused other kids to hate me, when I was just afraid of violating rules in which I learned to obey as a child.\\

In 10th grade I had resolved myself to enroll in the International Baccalaureate (IB) program that was notoriously academically difficult. In addition, IB required students to have good public speaking, writing, and interpersonal skills, all of which were my weaknesses. I remember questioning my capabilities but in end, I decided to grit my teeth and struggle through it. In retrospect, although the experience was very difficult mentally, physically, emotionally, I am glad I did it.\\
\hline
My first episodic memory I can remember was when I got in trouble in kindergarten for getting in a fight with another kid. My mom did not hit me but was emotionally disappointed in me which forever changed me as a person in a way where I became more considerate of others.\\

first day back to in person school. It felt really weird and so did the masks, trying to put online people to actual people was also weird.\\

The pandemic.

\hline
While chaotic, I remember crying while taking an online midterm last year and how I still passed with an A/B. This taught me how strong/resilient I am as an academic scholar and how I'm able to persevere in the most difficult times through my inner motivating voice/thoughts. It taught me coping mechanisms for how to calm myself down really quick in contexts.\\

During a period in which I started to begin hating to translate everything for my parents, at a financial office at the age of ten, I noticed there was a very old couple, with white and grey hair, in which were struggling immensely to get financial aid. Then minutes later, a young woman in a dress and a fancy handbag comes in, starts yelling at her old helpless parents, who looked so utterly fragile at this time, and being very frustrated on having to translate. I looked on at this possible future version of myself and told myself that I should never become like her, and it has forced me to become someone more understanding of the people around me, unlike the young lady who could not understand her parent's circumstances.\\

In 6th grade, my teacher was teaching a health lesson. She told us that if we could grab a handful of fat from our stomach, then we are overweight and have too much fat. I remember I was able to grab a handful and the two people on both sides of me couldn't grab any fat. I became aware again that I had much more fat than others. That same day, my teacher also said that if we squeeze our thighs and are able to see dimples (cellulite) then we have too much fat and are overweight. Once again, the two people next to me had no dimples. Prior to this, I had no idea what cellulite was or that it was a 'bad' thing. I hesitated wearing shorts from that day on. I became extremely insecure about my legs as a child.\\

In 3rd grade, our teacher put a strong emphasis on writing. We wrote many essays and presented to the class. Writing was a weakness I struggle with and so I very much disliked all the writing assignments she assigned. However, at the end of the year, our teacher got in contact with the local ABC channel 7 news station and got us a field trip to go to the news studio where we presented our essays on the news station set. I remember feeling really nervous yet accomplished and privileged to have this experience.\\
\hline
In my freshman year, I went on a party bus to midwinter. The mom on the bus brought out champagne for us (14 year olds) and everyone else except for me drank it. The mom then started playing sexual music and was dancing on some of my guy friends. She was kissing their necks and giving lap dances. I felt very uncomfortable and not safe. That night, I came home and did not tell my parents a thing because I was scared of what they would do to the mom and I was scared of being embarrassed at school if my parents ""snitched"". On Monday, everyone on the bus was called into the principals office to give a report of what happened. I told the truth in my letter because I knew that it wasn't worth getting in more trouble for. People thought that I was the reason we all got called into the principal's office and they called me ""sam the snitch"" or ""snitch bitch"" or ""sam the snake"". They even posted pictures of me with the snake emoji covering my face. I was being blamed for 'snitching' when it wasn't me who told the office what happened in the bus. When my parents found out, they were in disbelief that I did not tell them. The police ended up getting involved, and somehow the mom was not punished.\\
\hline
Getting in trouble for letting my friend look at my essay and format his own after it because of his personal issues and procrastination\\
\hline
While I hate my ex now, I remember being first asked out after our choir performances. It taught me how you can connect with someone with similar initial interests and what first love felt like. However, our couple of breakups, the reasons why, and my nights of crying to sleep (sometimes even during work shifts) really taught me what an unhealthy relationship looked like and what values I truly wanted (honesty not out of controlling but out of just respect and that deep friend connection, similar/the same conceptualizations of what cheating is, true inclusivity in shared friend groups (not just tolerance), prioritization in deep conversations (not solely just in giving gifts, physical affection, and dates. I wanted a balance in love languages), healthy work/life boundaries (aka respecting no call times during school/work), and the same future goals (Ex: marriage, no children but pets, etc.) as well as open-mindedness to differing political beliefs.\\
\hline
Finding out my best friend had serious issues.\\
\hline
Not being friends with the friend I had since elementary school. I found out his friend was talking bad about me to others and was just over all really toxic towards me for the past few years, and I remember how freeing it was when I told her that I knew and walked away.\\
\hline
When I was in kindergarten, my family moved. I was very sad about leaving my friends and family. We thought the move was permanent, but ended up moving back 3 months later because we did not like the community and we did not like being away from everyone we loved. My parents felt like the school system where we moved to was not very good compared to where we were before. My baby sister started to call the neighbor ""grandma"" and I think that is when my parents realized that we needed to come back home. Ever since then, we don't leave family.\\
\hline
In high school, I was in ASB and people thought that I was a goody-two-shoes and would not want to invite me to things. I felt left out.\\
\hline
The way i see others has been shaped by how i have been treated and how i see others treated while at work. I have been working for over a year now and i remember when i first started of course i was slower still learning how to do things and customers would get mad and complain about the time even if it was just a minute. There was this customer who was really mad that they waited for new food and it wasnt served to them first despite him ordering after a few others waiting as well and has a few rude comments and i remember it bothering me and i looked around to my co workers who didnt seem fazed by it at all. They tried to continue to be patient and later returned the same attitude. I learned that this happens often and they just got use to it. I was told never to take it personally or to let it ruin my day because in a few short hours i would clock out and that person was long gone. this really shaped how i am now and my attitude because i realize that i cant show that i am scared or shy i need to be more strong and be able to control myself as well. this experience helped me implement what was always told to me.\\

My first day in an American school. I felt like an outcast since my English wasn't very good and found it frustrating to communicate with others, I also felt really behind compared to other students since I did not speak fluent English. I remember walking around by myself in the playground and trying to get used to everything.\\
\hline
I liked playing soccer, and I was really great at intersecting balls and defending, however I once made the brief mistake of replicating something I saw on television. A sliding tackle in order to stop the ball, which had left a friend of mine with facial scars. This prevented me from playing aggressively in sports ever again, as I was always afraid I would hurt somebody accidentally, and I would start playing safer, which left me losing all passion for certain sports. I apologized, but it wasn't enough, that injury would mark him forever and I had to responsible to never do it again.\\
\hline
Realized I was in a 14 year old toxic friendship with people who did not care about me and made me the butt of every joke.\\
\hline
I took a summer class in algebra during middle school with 2 other students, one of which I maintained friendship with in high school. I remember struggling with the concept of factoring while my peers understood it fairly quickly. This was another time I felt I wasn't as smart as I thought I was.\\
\hline
The first time the word organic food was brought up in my environmental class (11th grade). I learned about all the negative-harmful chemicals that the FDA allowed for in our foods and realized that is why people are so unhealthy in the USA. I learned to be mindful of what I consume and saying no to harmful foods is okay (e.g. soda, fast food, etc.)\\
\hline
My first day of middle school. I remember how I struggled to figure out how to open a locker and my older brother taught to me how to open one and how I was late to my first class with a teacher I did not like because I couldn't open my locker.\\
\hline
Me and my (now ex) boyfriend started dating March 2022. We had been talking since January. I was hesitant because he is muslim and I am christian. I expressed my concerns and he said that we should not let that get in the way of our relationship because that is one small factor. I ended up agreeing, but it bothered me every day. He did not tell his parents that we were dating. Every time I would see them, I was nervous and felt pressured to be modest and not show that I liked him. This felt like lying. I told him I can't keep hiding this, and he ended up telling his parents. They were not mad and they welcomed me with open arms. I finally felt relief. We ended up falling deeper in love and celebrated many holidays together. I have never been treated so well in my entire life. I put in my everything into the relationship. Fast forward to January 2023, he broke up with me. He said that even though we are perfectly compatible, sometimes our differences in culture/religion are too much. He said I deserve better and that I deserve someone who shares the same beliefs as me. I am devastated. I was willing to compromise and was happy to compromise because it meant being with him, which was all I ever wanted. Even though I was willing to compromise, it wasn't enough. I am not enough. Again.\\

In high school, I was surprised to see a friend from middle school who had poor academic performance, excel in academics and got accepted into ivy league schools. I realized at that moment that my friend was smart but didn't care about school until high school. I realized that academics was not always a reliable indicator of intelligence or capability.\\

I was once confessed to by a Filipino girl in my early highschool years, and I was willing to try this relationship out as she was very intelligent and beautiful, the things I guess normal teenagers care about at that age. However, when I relayed this to an older brother figure of mine, whom I deeply respected at the time, that I was dating this girl, he immediately told me that regardless of her personality, wits, or beauty if I dated this girl, because she was Filipino, he would never ever associate himself with me ever again. The very next day, I told her I could no longer date her, for reasons I did not tell her, I completely ghosted her without her understanding anything. I feel immense guilt over this from time to time, and I sometimes wonder if I should have ever told her. To tell her, was to help her understand that it wasn't that I didn't like her, but to also reveal the racist intentions that I succumbed to because of my relationship with a racist older brother figure. However, what complicates this is long after this had occurred, I learned that the year before I came to his highschool he hated a Chicano girl and he was socially outcasted from all of his Korean friends as a result. He was perhaps trying to prevent that from happening to me, while also doing the same thing his friends did to him. It made me really think about circumstance and personal experience as being influencers to behavior.\\
\hline
Recently, I started losing weight and slowly fixing my severe acne on my face. Perhaps due to this, when I was ordering a sandwich at Substation, the cashier had snuck in a guestcheck with her number in the back and a note that said ""call me"". Although I am not mentally ready to date as of this moment, this had greatly boosted my confidence in myself, but it also made me avoid this place as a result. I am largely grateful, but I think I need to be a better person before I start dating.\\

When my parents kept yelling at me and making snarky remarks at me for missing days of school, defaming me in front of their relatives and stating that they're convinced I won't graduate every week. Even though it was clear the records indicated that I had a cumulative gpa of 4.0, I was neglected. This event made me understand that I should start caring about what my true objective is.\\
\hline
Hanging out with my best friends before we all leave for college.\\
\hline
In kindergarten, I had won some small trinkets for something I can’t remember. I left it in my pencil box and went out to play during lunch. When I returned, I noticed my prizes were not in my pencil box. After reporting it to the teacher, she found that the girl who had stolen from me was my friend. Although she returned everything to me, I remember feeling betrayed but since the prizes were not really important to me, I was able to forgive shortly after.\\
\hline
Having a relationship in which both sides were able to comfort each other. Specifically if I or he was to go through a rough time (e.g. switching jobs, moving schools, etc.) we would stay up late and comfort each other. This inspired and shaped me to be able to see when someone is struggling and want to help them in anyway I can because I know what it feels like to be in a place that is not so great.\\
\hline
On the other hand, getting rejected from auditions (honor choir, solo songs in middle school, and my county's holiday music fair) taught me that it's ok to accept failure and mistakes, then to work on them rather than dwell on it. As a person, it taught me how to accept constructive criticism with grace and how to implement feedback. It also taught me the importance of adaptation to different contexts (sometimes you need to sing classical and other times, pop holiday music. The same could be said about life. Sometimes it's best to do things one way, but other times a new approach is needed).\\

A true memory I really love is when I first meet my now current boyfriend at my local grocery store when he asked if I needed help finding items in the baking aisle. He taught me how true connections can be made even in the most mundane contexts and that life is full of surprises, but also I found someone who has similar values and respects my boundaries. Plus, he's exposed me to different cultural customs since he's italian/german/hispanic and made me realize that the right person will go the extra step not just to surprise you with gifts, but to nurture you in your not so best times and accept you in them.\\

My first fight. I was around the age 9 or 10 when it happened. My sister is deaf and was around 11 or 12. She was walking her dog up and down the street while I was in the living room of our house. I heard a sceam and knew it was my sister. I ran outside in flip flops and white muscle shirt. I see three boys around the same age poking my sister and the dog with a stick. I see that and grab the cloest thing to me which was a broom handle and took action. I went over there and fought all three little boys.\\
\hline
when asked who i am i think of being a kind and protective person. I would say this because i have followed what my parents have shown me and how they have protected me. More specifically how they shielded me from things. when i was little i had a little blue fish like the ones in the single cups at petco. I sweared that it had been alive for a year and a half even though many told me they dont live that long. After a little while they told me he had died which made me really sad at the time but it wasnt until maybe 3 years ago that they told me they had bought over 10 replacements. I was shocked and a little upset that they just let me believe that it was just the one i was given the first time even after i reached an age where i would understand. a little bit of thinking made me realize that it was mainly to keep me happy as a child, not wanting to introduce me to death so young since i felt so close with my pet fish. Now i see how it was beneficial for a while and it shaped me to want to do the same in the sense that i want to protect others from harmful things.\\
\hline
When I was a kid, there was an instance I was poking my head out the window and accidentally pressed the button that made the glass window reach all the way to my neck. Although my dad was telling me to stop moving while he was trying to get in the car, I figured out in my head that if the space I accidentally pressed made the window go up, the other side would let it go down and I did so even though my father was yelling not to. At the age of seven, I had a lot of confidence in myself I guess.\\

There was one morning in my first year of college where I had an 8am class. I woke up at 7:45 and saw my alarm going off. I was so tired and decided to go back to sleep.

Although I remained reserved, I was adamant on redeeming myself and held goals to soon show that I can demonstrate higher academic achievements for the sake of my pride. Even though it doesn't seem to be the righteous decision, I'm keen on redeeming myself.\\

Sophomore year of college was in person for the first time ever. I cried the first day because I had no friends. On the second day of school, a boy tapped me on the shoulder and asked to sit next to me. I said yes. After class, he asked for all of my social media information. We went on a semi-date, decided to be friends, and became very close friends. In January 2022, we went snowboarding as a group of friends. Me and the boy I met on the second day of school ended up kissing that night, transforming our relationship from friendship to more. I did not know how to tell my friends that we had progressed into more because I was scared of how it would affect our friendship. Eventually they found out and were hesitant yet supportive.\\
\hline
I have had a wonderful friendship since I was in middle school, she helped shape who I am by sticking to her morals and beliefs and inspired me to do the same. Examples are when I broke down and the ways she was able to be there and comfort me. We went through tough times together (fights with friend groups, her leaving to a different school, etc.) but have always been by each other side.\\

One day around 2 years ago, me and my mom drove around and did several Pokemon Go boss battles and won around 6-7 times because of my strategies. It made me feel proud of my planning skills.\\
\hline
I had a girl I liked as a young child, when I was in fifth grade, but she was a grade older. She was great at handball, which I really liked playing at that time, and she played rougher than anyone I knew, with such confidence. However, as she was older than me, she did graduate faster, and I never got the opportunity to interact with her ever again. I also soon moved, and I have never ever loved someone as romantically as I have had with her, ever again, although this occured when I was 10.\\
\hline
My dad used to always want me to play basketball as a child but I would get nervous and embarassed. I chose to play soccer and I ended up loving it, and so did he.\\
\hline
I remember in middle school some of my friends and I went to a friend’s house to hang out and play some games together. I remember having a good time, laughing and screaming with everyone.\\
\hline
Falling in love for the first time - realizing the extent to how much I could care about someone who wasn't family\\
\hline
My dad's cardiac arrest. Watching my dad go through dad in front of me and being in a coma for a while was really hard and one of the most life changing experiences. I was there when it happened and the image of him foaming at the mouth was hard to picture. I had to be there for my family, start working at our family ice cream shop, and pick up a lot of responsibilities as well as checking up on my dad (although I could not visit him because of covid)\\
\hline
In first grade, I remember looking at a picture of a 2D globe with people holding hands around it. It was weird to me that people in Antarctica were upside-down from my perspective but from their perspective, they would be right-side up. I remembering being confused and asking my parents why people in Antarctica weren't upside-down. They explained something about gravity that I just accepted at the time but didn't fully understand.\\
\hline
My ex-girlfriend, whom I was best friends with for two years prior to dating, completely stopped talking to me after a month and I never heard from them again for another two years.\\

Attending church all my life, still being pushed to go to church when I was older and didn't want to attend anymore\\
\hline
My mother pointing out homeless people on the street when we were driving around and her telling my brothers and I, ""That will be you if you don't do well in school.""\\
\hline
I remember in 8th grade I won an MVP award/medal for top grades and performance/personality as a student by my favorite history teacher named miss Brown. Personally, I never really like history (especially 1800s, civil wars, and geography). However, this memory makes me tear up sometimes because I was the last student she gave an award to before she got fired and rumors spread around about her absence (""she became ill and needed surgery,"" etc.). I never knew what happened to her and sometimes I miss the deep life talks I had with her (Ex: how to get involved in high school? Should I join certain clubs or classes if I feel I'm not well-suited for them? What's your best advice for high school and beyond?), but just the thought that a teacher had so much faith and hope in me as a student really influences me today when I experience imposter syndrome as an undergrad. I remember that I still have those basic qualities of a top student (perfect attendance, detailed notes, on time assignments mostly, and always asking questions) and I belong in academia.\\
\hline
in 5th grade, I remember a classmate and I were doing particularly well in math. The teacher therefore gave us extra worksheets on extremely basic concepts in algebra. The other classmate would consistently finish the worksheets faster and with less mistakes compared to me. I remember feeling smart because I was doing work more advanced compared to my classmates yet not as smart as the other classmate who was doing it with me. He now goes to CalTech.\\
\hline
My grandpa passing away while I was in 6th grade, I heard it from my friend at school about his passing since she overheard my mom and teacher on the phone. experienced loss young and had to find out from someone else\\
\hline
My sessions with my therapist and my hard-headed side that is incapable of change in beliefs, helped understand that therapy is dependent on the patient. People only change when they want to and/or is open to change. Therapy isn't a magic remedy, it is more of emotional regulation.\\
\hline
As an elementary schooler, I remember my mother getting me a science kit that used baking soda and vinegar to create a small volcano. We expected the volcano to be bigger but the whole activity was creating a small pile of baking soda and dripping vinegar with food dye on it to react. My mother’s exaggerated and sarcastic excitement made me laugh and became an inside joke.\\
\hline
As a kid, I was extremely oblivious to the skin condition I had which was eczema. However, I eventually noticed the pity looks I would receive at events. This was a crucial moment for me because I realized that I wasn’t necessarily “normal.”\\
\hline
In first grade, I remember I felt discouraged that I could not read chapter books while my peers were. I remember my mother getting me a book from the ""Frog and Toad"" series to practice. Upon completing a book, I felt a bit less discouraged but still felt I was behind my peers. I believe this moment was one of the reasons I enjoy reading today.\\
\hline
In High school, my team and I took part in a robotics competition. I remember cheering for my team with all my teammates and celebrating qualifications to the national competition. When we returned to the hotel, I remember playing cards with my roommates and laughing until we couldn’t breathe. We fooled around before I reluctantly got to work on homework while my friends continued having fun.\\
\hline
Me and my brother would go to church with my Grammy when we were younger and had spent the night at her house. I used to hate it a lot only because I had to wake up early, but she would always get us McDonald's breakfast.\\
\hline
I remember when these boys at school in my chemistry class would ask me questions about different sports and their teams. They wanted to see if I was really intrested in sports or if I was lying. I always knew what I was talking about and for some reason it surprised them. This made me want to learn even more about the world of sports.\\
\hline
The very first time I was offered weed. I was in sixth grade and I have a friend who had a good heart but came from a broken home. He was always there for me and he grew up to be part of the street life style. Anyway, we were starting 7th grade and the first day before going he had brought weed. I did not partake but he smoked it in front of me before school.\\
\hline
College apps. Taught me perseverance and I remember working on them on halloween where I dressed up as pitbull, making me reflect on how much I grew from being social anxious to showing up to school in a bald cap.\\
\hline
Going out on solo trips by myself - made me realize I don't need to go out places with friends all the time to enjoy things, can enjoy me time, time alone is therapy\\
\hline
Relatedly, I remember when my community college English 1B professor gave voice audio feedback on my semester paper to say that I should publish it in the school's journal/research portal because it was that well written. Also, I remember the fact that she literally edited my UCR essays in a couple days by 12 am and that her quote was ""Don't let perfection be the enemy of the good."" The very first part boosted my self-esteem as a writer and even influenced me to seek out research labs now. Also, it's reinforced my dream to possibly write a book and publish it or at least write my original songs for youtube. However, as someone with ADD and major procrastination issues due to heightened anxiety over having everything perfect, her quote has become my moto during tough times now as a student and again, her grading my essays really late made me realize that while we shouldn't override boundaries and be more responsible, you should have the minimum expectation that your faculty and colleagues want you to succeed because you're a good enough scholar/worker/person!\\
\hline
I worked at the medical records section of a clinic for a few months, and it helped me realize the value of working hard for your own money.\\
\hline
Overhearing how a classmate of mine has a private tutor in middle school which is the reason why he was in advanced classes. I realized to money difference between my classmates and I and how fortunate some people are and how they don't realize it. It made me understand and notice the things I am grateful for and ungrateful for.\\
\hline
Graduating from ELA. I was so happy to finish the English learners program in fourth grade and I remember my teacher jumping, screaming, and hugging me with joy because she was really happy for me and I felt proud of myself to have accomplished that.\\
\hline
When I first moved out for college on my own. My parents helped me deliver my things to my new house where I was on my own. It was scary but taught me a lot of things. It taught me how to rely on myself and get things done.\\
\hline
One day when I was in Grand Teton National Park, I became obsessed with the Jalapeno Kettle Brand Chips that my brothers were eating. Ever since then, they have made me much more passionate about snacking.\\
\hline
I remember one day after picking me up from middle school, my grandmother asked me what I wanted to eat. I told her I wanted fried chicken but because her English was not very good, she only understood that I wanted chicken. She made me a boiled chicken dish. I had not expected this and thought it was really funny. Although I didn’t think much of this at the time, now that I’m older, I hold these memories endearing.\\
\hline
My second episodic memory was when it was my fifth birthday and I had very little consciousness on what was going on, however in that moment I felt the greatest sense of satisfaction of obtaining gifts, cake, and a large gathering of people I knew, knowing it couldn't get any better than this.\\
\hline
Being compared to my brother constantly (I received praise while he did not). I realized that this is what made him deeply dislike me even though we didn't have much interactions and if we did I normally would gift him something small. This caused me to try and mend our relationship and allowed for me to notice it in any future friendships that I had.\\

\hline
Back in August, I started watching this Disney Cartoon called ""Amphibia"". I initially thought it was kind of boring, but soon came to appreciate its lessons about how you should always try to grow as a person.\\
\hline
In general high school has taught me how unreliable people can be. I saw how much people talked behind each others backs and how to each others faces they said they were best friends and how well they got along. this really influenced me to keep to myself and not to tell too much to anyone. i could see the way different people acted with different sets of groups. just seeing this really influenced me to keep to myself more and being more shy.\\
\hline
I was raise Christian but my world view aligned more with materialists. I changed my world view in the first week of college when I came to realized how Nihilistic and meaningless everything was with my current world view. Reflecting back on my life, I recognized how my past experiences have shaped who I am and lead me to this moment. I recognized how good my situation is compared to the less fortunate and how God has worked in my life. I decided to fully commit to Christianity henceforth.\\
\hline
I was surprised to realize that some of my friends truly believed in God and that made me question religion twice. However, I still don't believe in God, but now I understand why people do.\\
\hline
In 6th grade, I was sent to the principal's office because my shorts were 'too short'. I was wearing the exact same shorts that all of my friends were wearing, but I had a larger butt and thighs. She told me that I dress inappropriately and that I needed to buy longer shorts that fit me. I did not know what to do because I was the only one of my friends to get in trouble for wearing the exact same thing that they were wearing.\\
\hline
I remember being in middle school around my first year when i started to be friends with my partner in science class. my family is catholic but we were never supper religious like going to church every Sunday and every religious day/event. I remember how openly and confident she was in talking about going to church and being religious. Now that i realize it, she influenced me to become more accepting to myself. Shortly after my mom asked be if i wanted to sign up for communion classes because ultimately it was my choice and my mom said she wouldnt force me into a religion i dont want to practice. in the end that shaped how i went on with my classes because i decided that this would be the best option for me. Now my family and i try to go more often and not just on holidays since they started going to the parent portion of my classes which made all of us attend more and be a little more religious.\\
\hline
Coming home in 4th or 5th grade with the first 2 on my report card (there is a system of 1-4, where if you got a 1 is the equivalent of a D or F and 4 is an A). My parents were disappointed but not overly so. This is the point where my academic validation habit began.\\
\hline
I also remember going to my first Ram's game. We lost against the Balitomore Ravens but It was fun to experience. Just me and my dad went and I felt so happy just enjoying the moment with him.\\
\hline
In South Korea, my family was extremely poor, and I remember being so happy when I was afforced two dollars to buy a special treat called Tteokbokki. In this period of time, food was one of the only enjoyments I had in life, but not every food I adjusted to. Growing up on hamburgers and pizza, it was hard for me to casually consume school lunches in Korea that barely had any meat, and a lot of vegetables. However, I was really really happy when I could eat this street food and it has been one of my most important memories during this period of time.\\
\hline
When I was a young child, my family and I went up to a small pond with some church friends to go fishing. This was my first experience fishing and so I was excited. I don’t remember much about the event except when one of adults fishing with us saw that I was struggling to catch any fish. And so he just shoved my fishing hook into a fish and told me I had caught a it. Looking back, I find this memory hilarious.\\
\hline
In high school, I took a class called Transpersonal Psychology. In the class, we did an activity called the Truth Process where we would go around in a circle as a class and share things we wouldn’t normally share. I shared a series of events that filled me with guilt, ultimately reflecting and concluding that I am not my mistakes. It helped with my self growth.\\
\hline
I remember singing ""This girl is on Fire"" by Alicia Keys in class and two of my fellow classmates complimenting me, then encouraging me to join my 5th grade's talent show. After their encouragement, I sang ""Just Give Me a Reason"" at the 5th grade talent show and my brother posted it on Youtube. This is a very fundamental memory for me because it shaped my continual development as a blossoming singer and made me realize/enjoy the feeling of bringing/entertaining people as a whole at events.\\
\hline
The day I was accpeted to my first college. It was late, around 11pm on a school night. My senior year and I am waiting to hear back from colleges. So that night I check my email and see my first acceptance. I was beyond estatic. I knew I was going somewhere, that all my hard work paid off.\\
\hline
Uploading singing/piano covers and originals on youtube from 13-18 was an integral memory that made me realize my top value of emotional expression and open communication. Plus, it taught me perseverance and dedication/commitment as well as to pursue my dreams no matter what people said.\\
\hline
I was over weight in elementary school and felt insecure about it. I tried to become the class clown to cope and make friends. But in middle school, there was another kid who was better at being the funny guy than I was. I remember giving up on being the funny guy and turned to academics. I didn’t care about school in elementary school but I felt a had a responsibility to prepare for the future now. Ever since then, academic success has been a major priority in my life.\\
\hline
I remember in kindergarten, the teacher would lead an activity where she would teach us a letter of the alphabet and give examples. She taught the alphabet in order and used cards with the letter and an example image. I remember she would always ask us to guess what the example image on the card was. At this time, I would always ask to use the bathroom and use that opportunity to go to the neighboring empty classroom, which had all the cards displayed on the wall. I would return to class knowing the example for the letter of the day and pretended to “guess” the right answer.\\
\hline
Learning how to drive has shaped me because it had to be done in the moment i couldn't just wait for it to come to me because i needed to be able to drive myself to ucr and back home. it was hard because i did it all in a month, getting my permit, license and going farther than i had ever practiced. Its about an hour drive so i feel like i was able to grow and be stronger and believing in my capabilities much more.\\
\hline
In high school, my peers were consistently outperforming me in every subject and activity. This was when I was humbled and realized that I wasn’t as smart as I thought I was and being smart wasn’t an uncommon thing. However, I was convinced that as long as I worked hard enough, I could at least be on par with the best. In retrospect, I think it would have been better for my mental and physical health to become better than my past self than compete with my peers.\\
\hline

Auditioning for my high school's top madrigals choir and getting accepted was the start of my journey as a soprano section leader as well as the choir's top contra soprano to sing descants. It was a time of travel to the Mission Inn's church, Sizzler, Redland's University, and Cal State Fullerton where I sang carols/classical music and admired other choirs in competition. Also, it led me to sing the alma mater for my school's online graduation during Covid. These experiences shaped me as a musician and encouraged me to further hone these skills in college (and beyond if I audition for the Voice). However, it all started from a simple audition into it and acceptance, which I will never forget.\\
\hline
My attendance to my Aunt's church in Riverside where the pastor engaged others' in biblical discussions and cited the importance of particular verses to our lives followed by pop church bands/musicians really changed my perspective on religion. In fact, I haven't been to church since Covid, but I have always told myself that I want to buy a bible from harvest church and go back to find a church that suits me. This is because I realized religion and spirituality doesn't have to be mundane and one dimensional in interpretation/view. It can be engaging an down to earth like real life.\\
\hline
I remember my research methods professor in community college would give me internships and career advice during office hours but also during her class at the end of the semester. Also, I remember she said that even after her class, we can always reach out to her. In fact, she was one of the most generous and caring professors I had, but she also taught me that it's ok to ask for advice/help and it's ok to not have the whole future planned out. She taught me that I need to get involved in different opportunities to solidify my true passions. which I'm currently planning to do for next quarter by applying for work study and/or maybe a lab.\\

Tutoring online for the DRC at my community college as well as the workshops required influenced me to become a more diversity accepting person and open minded person to learning from others.

\hline
Recently, I hosted a wedding in Redland's citrus grove and a retirement event in the mountains at a farm for my brother's photobooth business. Those experiences grounded me with peace and allowed me to appreciate others' kindness (Ex: food giving, bug spray, etc.). Plus, it gave me perspective and possibilities for the future while also allowing me to gain wisdom from older individuals that have more life experience. Plus, it taught me the importance of taking a break in nature.\\

Being able to manage writing a research paper for my english class in community college while working 9 days a week (a little over part-time) taught me the power of time confetti and pomodoro, which I still use in my studying.\\

\hline
When my best friend's mom took us to a doctor's science fair. It was for us to see if we would like to be in the medical field.\\
\hline
My mom took me to her job for a couple of years over the summer and I grew a love for cosmetology. I used to get my nails done all the time after my mom would do my hair.\\
\hline
Me and my Godsister went to taco bell together one time at night and it was one of the best experiences that I had.\\
\hline
My dad introduced me to StarWars when I was younger and I grew close to the characters and universe.\\
\hline
My dad also introduced me to Marvel when I was a kid and that influenced a lot of my intrest in movies and friendships.\\
\hline
My family always watches movies together on Saturday and Sunday night. We would make or order dinner and sit and eat together just finally getting to relax together and enjoy our family time.\\
\hline
While me and my brother were playing one day, I fell and busted my eye open. This caused my blood vessles to pop and I ended up going to the hospital the next day.\\
\hline
During my sophomore year in high school, my mom made a bet with me to get Straight A's and then I could have a TV in my room. I ended up getting the A's and she bought me a TV a couple weeks later that my dad set up.\\
\hline
During the month of september on President's day weekend, Arizona has a soccer competition for the leagues to enter and compete. It is the Laughlin tournament. It is really fun but also super cold. I would go every year when I used to play. It was a super fun weekend and I loved that my parents would always take me even if it meant they couldn't rest that specific weekend.\\
\hline
I wasn't allowed to have social media until I was older and actually didn't end up getting it until I was 16. I didn't even get a phone until I was 13 and I didn't know this was considered ""different"" compared to other kids.\\
\hline
I entered the middle college program when I was in my junior year of high school. I loved it at first but quickly reached a realization. However, I did earn 4 associate degrees at 18 years old because of this.\\
\hline
My favorite color as a child was blue. I loved this color and I remember the kids at school would always tell me it was a boy color and that I should change it.\\
\hline
I remember going to my first Laker game as a kid and seeing Kobe Bryant play live. We won that game and I got to see his post-game interview. My parents took me and my brother once we finished the school year with straight A's.\\
\hline
I had two graduations at the end of high school. One was for my college and the other was for my high school. I was so happy I got the opportunity to have two graduations and experience that moment of sonder twice.\\
\hline
For my 17th birthday my mom got me a Laker's cake. It was one of the best cakes I've ever had because it had strawberries in it. I loved that cake and it was very special to me.\\
\hline
One of my favorite memories with my brother is during summer when we would let India into the Garage and play with her, and we would also watch Let it Shine everyday. It was the most fun ever. I loved playing with our dog and watching the same movie over and over again. We would also eat hot pockets everyday.\\
\hline
I loved Saturday's with my dad as well. My mom would be at work until the night but me and my dad would spend all day together watching corny movies on SYFY and watching WWE as well.\\
\hline
-\\
\hline
Riding a scooter down hills when I was younger. I was able to hang out with my family and friends this way. It conditioned me to always love the outdoors since I was able to associate it with positive experiences.\\
\hline
Going to the same park trails since I was very very young. I was able to use this time to talk with whoever I was with about what was happening in my life and theirs.\\
\hline
Working out for the first time on a consistive schedule. It made me feel so powerful and good about myself! It helped me learn to love my body and associate working out and being health with positive feelings.\\
\hline
When I was younger about 7 to 9 years old, I tried to shoplift a toy (or something) by putting it in a backpack that my mom was going to buy for school. We didn't have any money that could be spent (only on the essentials). I obviously got caught at the register and my mom scolded me and I never did it again. This specific experience made me realize how important money is and how little we had of it. This was also at a thrift store when people made fun of me for going thrifting since it was the only place my family could afford.\\
\hline
When I was about 15 years old and my brother was around 17 or 18, I realized how much food he needed (he was on the football team, worked out a lot, etc). We still didn't have much money to spend on food that we really needed to be healthy so whenever we got fast food -- which he loves -- I would eat a very small portion and say I'm full so that he could get the extra food that I didn't touch. This made me conscious of how little we had, and how I should do my best to look after my family and others.\\

  Outward implications predicts how fundamental or important to change
  an experience was, how clearly defined/certain in memory one is, and
  how representative the experience is\ldots{}
\item
  Inward causes predict positivity (across self-report and positivity of
  text used) but not negativity
\item
  Superordinance: More outward implications, more broad\ldots{} Like
  foundation of a building, the most causal are the most broadward

\item
  How can we support that if memory did not exist, it's consequences

  increased the propensity of B, perhaps even made B inevitable. We
  suggest that a test of causality by simulation is involved in examples
  such as''you know very well that they would have quarrelled even if
  she had not mentioned his mother.'' - Kahneman \& Tversky, 1981

  Gerstenberg et al., 2022 on sustaining causation (blocks causing other
  blocks to be supported) ask to predict which blocks would fall if the
  black one were removed (selection), how many of the blocks would fall
  (prediction), and how responsible the black block is for the red
  blocks staying on the table (responsibility).

  Is there a way to implement ``Prediction'' and ``Responsibility''
  conditions?

\item
  Collect data, generate networks, implement perturbations to network,
  and measure the extent to which participants predict instability
